This folder contains the scripts & data necessary to replicate the tables and figures in "INSERT TITLE HERE" (PVS).

-----

Replication instructions:

In order to run the scripts smoothly you need to make sure that:

1) All the R packages indicated in the R scripts under the sections "libraries" are installed.

2) Your working directory for both R and Stata is the folder in which the scripts are unzipped and that
the data is living in the ./Data subdirectory and a ./Figures subdirectory exists where plots can be saved.
