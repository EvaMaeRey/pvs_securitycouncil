The Security Council,  
Having considered the situation in Cyprus in response to the complaint submitted by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus,  
Having heard the report of the Secretary-General and the statements made by the parties concerned,  
Deeply concerned at the continuation of the crisis in Cyprus,  
Recalling its previous resolutions, in particular resolution 365 (1974) of 13 December 1974 by which it endorsed General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) adopted unanimously on 1 November 1974,  
Noting the absence of progress towards the implementation of its resolutions,  
1.       Calls once more upon all States to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus and urgently requests them, as well as the parties concerned, to refrain from any action which might prejudice that sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment, as well as from any attempt at partition of the island or its unification with any other country;  
2.       Regrets the unilateral decision of 13 February 1975 declaring that a part of the Republic of Cyprus would become "a Federated Turkish State" as, inter alia, tending to compromise the continuation of negotiations between the representatives of the two communities on an equal footing, the objective of which must continue to be to reach freely a solution providing for a political settlement and the establishment of a mutually acceptable constitutional arrangement, and expresses its concern over all unilateral actions by the parties which have compromised or may compromise the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions;  
3.       Affirms that the decision referred to in paragraph 2 above does not prejudge the final political settlement of the problem of Cyprus and takes nots of the declaration that this was not its intention;  
4.       Calls for the urgent and effective implementation of all parts and provisions of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX), endorsed by Security Council resolution 365 (1974) ;  
5.       Considers that new efforts should be undertaken to assist the resumption of the negotiations referred to in paragraph 4 of resolution 3212 (XXIX) between the representatives of the two communities;  
6.       Requests the Secretary-General accordingly to undertake a new mission of good offices and to that end to convene the parties under new agreed procedures and place himself personally at their disposal, so that the resumption, the intensification and the progress of comprehensive negotiations, carried out in a reciprocal spirit of understanding and of moderation under his personal auspices and with his direction as appropriate, might thereby be facilitated;  
7.       Calls upon the representatives of the two communities to co-operate closely with the Secretary-General in the discharge of this new mission of good offices and asks them to accord personelly a high priority to their negotiations;  
8.       Calls upon all the parties concerned to refrain from any actions which might jeopardize the negotiations between the representatives of the two communities and to take steps which will facilitate the creation of the climate necessary for the success of the negotiations;  
9.       Requests the Secretary-General to keep the Security Council informed of the progress made twowrds the implementation of resolution 365 (1974) and of the present resolutions and to report to the Council whenever he considers it appropriate and, in any case, before 15 June 1975;  
10.     Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
