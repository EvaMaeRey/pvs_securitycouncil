The Security Council,  
Considering that a grave situation has been created by action undertaken against Egypt,  
Taking into account that the lack of unanimity of its permanent members at the 749th and 750th meetings of the Security Council has prevented it from exercising its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,  
Decides to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly, as provided in General Assembly resolution 377 A (V) of 3 November 1950, in order to make appropriate recommendations.  
Adopted at the 751st meeting by 7 votes to 2 (France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), with 2 abstentions (Australia, Belgium).
