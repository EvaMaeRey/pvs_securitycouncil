17 (1947).            Resolution of 10 February 1947  
Whereas the Commission of Investigation established by the Security Council by its resolution 15 (1946) of 19 December 1946 has referred to the Council the question of whether the Commission's request to the Greek Government to postpone the execution of persons sentenced to death by that Government for political offences is covered by the terms of reference in such resolution,  
It is resolved that the Security Council request the Secretary-General to advise the Commission of Investigation that it is the sense of the Security Council that the Commission, acting under resolution 15 (1946) adopted by the Council on 19 December 1946, is not empowered to request the appropriate authorities of Greece, Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to postpone the execution of any persons sentenced to death, unless the Commission has reason to believe that the examination of any such person as a witness would assist the Commission in its work, and makes its request on this ground.  
Adopted at the 101st meeting by 9 votes to none, with 2 abstentions (Poland, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).
