Reaffirming also its full support for the Agreements signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 (S/23177, annex),  
Noting the report of the Secretary-General of 19 February 1992 (S/23613) submitted pursuant to resolution 718 (1991) ,  
Desiring to contribute to the restoration and maintenance of peace in Cambodia, to the promotion of national reconciliation, to the protection of human rights, and to the assurance of the right to self-determination of the Cambodian people through free and fair elections,  
Convinced that free and fair elections are essential to produce a just and durable settlement to the Cambodia conflict, thereby contributing to regional and international peace and security,  
Mindful of Cambodia's recent tragic history and determined that the policies and practices of the past will not be repeated,  
Expressing appreciation for the work of the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC) in the maintenance of the cease-fire, in mine awareness and mine clearance, and in preparation for the deployment of a United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC),  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and the Supreme National Council under his chairmanship in regard to the implementation of the provisions of the Agreements,  
Welcoming the appointment by the Secretary-General of a Special Representative for Cambodia to act on his behalf,  
1.       Approves the report of the Secretary-General of 19 February 1992 (S/23613) containing his plan, which is subject to re-examination in the light of experience, for implementing the mandate envisaged in the Agreements;  
2.       Decides that UNTAC shall be established under its authority in accordance with the above-mentioned report for a period not to exceed eighteen months;  
3.       Decides that it is vital that an election be held in Cambodia by May 1993 at the latest as recommended by the Secretary-General in paragraph 38 of his report (S/23613);  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General to deploy UNTAC as rapidly as that possible to implement the above decision, urges that both the deploymentd and the further implementation of his plan be done in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible, and invites him to that end to keep the operation under continuous review, bearing in mind the fundamental objectives of the Agreements;  
5.       Calls upon the Supreme National Council of Cambodia to fulfil its special responsibilities set out in the Agreements;  
6.       Calls further upon all parties concerned to comply scrupulously with the terms of the Agreements, to cooperate fully with UNTAC in the implementation of its mandate, and to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of all United Nations personnel;  
7.       Calls further upon the Supreme National Council and all Cambodians on behalf of the host country to provide all necessary assistance and facilities to UNTAC;  
8.       Strongly urges the Cambodian parties to agree to the complete demobilization of their military forces prior to the end of the process of registration for the elections as well as to the destruction of the weapons and ammunition deposited into UNTAC custody in excess of those, if any, which may be deemed necessary by UNTAC for the maintenance of civil order and national defence, or which may be required by the new Cambodian Government;  
9.       Appeals to all States to provide all voluntary assistance and support necessary to the United Nations and its programmes and specialized agencies for the preparations and operations to implement the Agreements, including for rehabilitation and for the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons;  
10.     Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council by 1 June 1992 and subsequently to report to the Council in September 1992, January 1993, and in April 1993 on progress to date in the implementation of the present resolution and on tasks still to be performed in the operation, with particular regard to the most effective and efficient use of resources;  
11.     Decides to remain seized of the matter.
