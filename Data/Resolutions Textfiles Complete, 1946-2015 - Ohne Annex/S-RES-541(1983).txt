The Security Council,  
Having heard the statement of the Foreign Minister of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus,  
Concerned at the declaration by the Turkish Cypriot authorities issued on 15 November 1983 which purports to create an independent State in northern Cyprus,  
Considering that this declaration is incompatible with the 1960 Treaty concerning the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus and the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee,  
Considering, therefore, that the attempt to create a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is invalid, and will contribute to a worsening of the situation in Cyprus,  
Reaffirming its resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975) ,  
Aware of the need for a solution of the Cyprus problem based on the mission of good offices undertaken by the Secretary-General,  
Affirming its continuing support for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus,  
Taking note of the Secretary-General's statement of 17 November 1983,  
1.       Deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus;  
2.       Considers the declaration referred to above as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal;  
3.       Calls for the urgent and effective implementation of its resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975) ;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General to pursue his mission of good offices, in order to achieve the earliest possible progress towards a just and lasting settlement in Cyprus;  
5.       Calls upon the parties to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices;  
6.       Calls upon all States to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus;  
7.       Calls upon all States not to recognize any Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus;  
8.       Calls upon all States and the two communities in Cyprus to refrain from any action which might exacerbate the situation;  
9.       Requests the Secretary-General to keep the Security Council fully informed.
