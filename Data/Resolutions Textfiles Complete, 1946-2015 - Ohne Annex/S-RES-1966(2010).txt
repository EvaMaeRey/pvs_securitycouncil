Resolution 1966 (2010)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 6463rd meeting, on 22 December 2010
The Security Council,
Recalling Security Council resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, which established the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ("ICTY"), and resolution 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994, which established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ("ICTR"), and all subsequent relevant resolutions,
Recalling in particular Security Council resolutions 1503 (2003) of 28 August 2003 and 1534 (2004) of 26 March 2004, which called on the Tribunals to take all possible measures to complete investigations by the end of 2004, to complete all trial activities at first instance by the end of 2008, and to complete all work in 2010 ("completion strategy"), and noting that those envisaged dates have not been met,
Acknowledging the considerable contribution the Tribunals have made to international criminal justice and accountability for serious international crimes, and the re-establishment of the rule of law in the countries of the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda,
Recalling that the Tribunals were established in the particular circumstances of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda as ad hoc measures contributing to the restoration and maintenance of peace,
Reaffirming its determination to combat impunity for those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and the necessity that all persons indicted by the ICTY and ICTR are brought to justice,
Recalling the statement of the President of the Security Council of 19 December 2008 (S/PRST/2008/47), and reaffirming the need to establish an ad hoc mechanism to carry out a number of essential functions of the Tribunals, including the trial of fugitives who are among the most senior leaders suspected of being most responsible for crimes, after the closure of the Tribunals,
Emphasizing that, in view of the substantially reduced nature of the residual functions, the international residual mechanism should be a small, temporary and efficient structure, whose functions and size will diminish over time, with a small number of staff commensurate with its reduced functions,
