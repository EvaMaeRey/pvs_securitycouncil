The Security Council,  
Having considered the letter dated 1 October 1985 (S/17509) in which Tunisia made a complaint against Israel following the act of aggression which the latter committed against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia,  
Having heard the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia,  
Having noted with concern that the Israeli attack has caused heavy loss of human life and extensive material damage,  
Considering that, in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations, all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,  
Gravely concerned at the threat to peace and security in the Mediterranean region posed by the air raid perpetrated on 1 October 1985 by Israel in the area of Hamman-Plage, situated in the southern suburb of Tunis,  
Drawing attention to the serious effect which the aggression carried out by Israel and all acts contrary to the Charter cannot but have on any initiative designed to establish an overall, just and lasting peace in the Middle East,  
Considering that the Israeli Government claimed responsibility for the attack as soon as it had been carried out,  
1.       Condemns vigorously the act of armed aggression perpetrated by Israel against Tunisian territory in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and norms of conduct;  
2.       Demands that Israel refrain from perpetrating such acts of aggression or from the threat to do so;  
3.       Urgently requests the States Members of the United Nations to take measures to dissuade Israel from resorting to such acts against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States;  
4.       Considers that Tunisia has the right to appropriate reparations as a result of the loss of human life and material damage which it has suffered and for which Israel has claimed responsibility;  
5.       Requests the Secretary-General to report to it on the implementation of this resolution by 30 November 1985 at the latest;  
6.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
