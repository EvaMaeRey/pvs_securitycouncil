The Security Council,  
Taking note of the letter dated 6 April 1994 from the Permanent Representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the United Nations to the Secretary-General (S/1994/402) and the letter dated 13 April 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Chad to the United Nations to the Secretary-General (S/1994/424), and the annexures thereto,  
Welcoming the agreement signed at Surt on 4 April 1994 between the Governments of Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgment delivered by the International Court of Justice on 3 February 1994 regarding the Aouzou strip,  
Having considered the letter of the Secretary-General dated 13 April 1994 (S/1994/432) advising of his intention to send a reconnaissance team to the area to conduct a survey of conditions on the ground regarding the possible deployment of United Nations observers to monitor the withdrawal by Libya from the area in question,  
Recognizing that the team will need to travel to Libya by United Nations aircraft and that this will require an exemption from the provisions of paragraph 4 of resolution 748 (1992) of 31 March 1992, and acting, in this respect, under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  
1.       Decides that paragraph 4 of resolution 748 (1992) of 31 March 1992 shall not apply in respect of United Nations aircraft flying to or from Libya for the purpose of conveying the Secretary-General's reconnaissance team;  
2.       Requests the Secretary-General to inform the Committee established pursuant to resolution 748 (1992) of flights made to or from Libya in accordance with the present resolution.
