The Security Council,  
Having considered the letter dated 25 November 1979 from the Secretary-General (S/13646),  
Deeply concerned at the dangerous level of tension between Iran and the United States of America, which could have grave consequences for international peace and security,  
Recalling the appeal made by the President of the Security Council on 9 November 1979 (S/13616), which was reiterated on 27 November 1979 (S/13652),  
Taking note of the letter dated 13 November 1979 from the Foreign Minister of Iran (S/13626) relative to the grievances of Iran,  
Mindful of the obligation of States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered,  
Conscious of the responsibility of States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of their missions,  
1.       Urgently calls on the Government of Iran to release immediately the personnel of the Embassy of the United States of America being held in Teheran, to provide them protection and to allow them to leave the country;  
2.       Further calls on the Governments of Iran and of the United States of America to take steps to resolve peacefully the remaining issues between them to their mutual satisfaction in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations;  
3.       Urges the Governments of Iran and of the United States of America to exercise the utmost restraint in the prevailing situation;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General to lend his good offices for the immediate implementation of this resolution and to take all appropriate measures to this end;  
5.       Decides that the Council will remain actively seized of the matter and requests the Secretary-General to report urgently to it on developments regarding his efforts.
