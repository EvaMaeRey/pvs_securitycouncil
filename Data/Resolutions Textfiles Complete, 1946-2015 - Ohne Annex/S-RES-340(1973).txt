Noting with regret the reported repeated violations of the cease-fire in non-compliance with resolutions 338 (1973) and 339 (1973),  
Noting with concern from the Secretary-General's report[1] that the United Nations military observers have not yet been enabled to place themselves on both sides of the cease-fire line,

2.         Requests the Secretary-General, as an immediate step, to increase the number of United Nations military observers on both sides;  
3.         Decides to set up immediately, under its authority, a United Nations Emergency Force to be composed of personnel drawn from States members of the United Nations except the permanent members of the Security Council, and requests the Secretary-General to report within 24 hours on the steps taken to his effect;  
4.         Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council on an urgent and continuing basis on the state of implementation of the present resolution, as well as resolutions 338 (1973) and 339 (1973);  
5.         Requests all Member States to extend their full co-operation to the United Nations in the implementation of the present resolution, as well as resolutions 338 (1973) and 339 (1973).
