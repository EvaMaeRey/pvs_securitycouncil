The Security Council,  
Taking note of the letter of the Permanent Representative of Greece dated 10 August 1976,  
Having heard and noted the various points made in the statements by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Greece and Turkey,  
Expressing its concern over the present tensions between Greece and Turkey in relation to the Agean Sea,  
Bearing in mind the principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes, as well as the various provisions of Chapter VI of the Charter concerning procedures and methods for the peaceful settlement of disputes,  
Noting the importance of the resumption and continuance of direct negotiations between Greece and Turkey to resolve their differences,  
Conscious of the need for the parties both to respect each other's international rights and obligations and to avoid any incident which might lead to the aggravation of the situation and which, consequently, might compromise their efforts towards a peaceful solution,  
1.       Appeals to the Governments of Greece and Turkey to exercise the utmost restraint in the present situation;  
2.       Urges the Governments of Greece and Turkey to do everything in their power to reduce the present tensions in the area so that the negotiating process may be facilitated;  
3.       Calls upon the Governments of Greece and Turkey to resume direct negotiations over their differences and appeals to them to do everything within their power to ensure that these negotiations will result in mutually acceptable solutions;  
4.       Invites the Governments of Greece and Turkey in this respect to continue to take into account the contribution that appropriate judicial means, in particular the International Court of Justice, are qualified to make to the settlement of any remaining legal differences which they may identify in connexion with their present dispute.
