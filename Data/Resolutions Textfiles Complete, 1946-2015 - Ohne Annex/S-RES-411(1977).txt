The Security Council,  
Taking note of the telegram dated 18 June 1977 from the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique, Mr. Samora Moises Machel, to the Secretary General, contained in document S/12350 and Add.1,  
Having heard the statement of Mr. Marcelino dos Santos, member of the Permanent Political Committee of FRELIMO and Minister for Development and Economic Planning of Mozambique, concerning the recent acts of aggression against Mozambique committed by the illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia,  
Taking note of the resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity at its twenty-ninth ordinary session at Libvreville, Gabon,  
Indignant at the systematic acts of aggression committed by the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia against the People's Republic of Mozambique and the resulting loss of life and destruction of property,  
Gravely concerned at the rapidly deteriorating situation in Southern Rhodesia as a result of the continued existence of the illegal regime,  
Reaffirming the inalienable right of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and independence, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, and the legitimacy of their struggle to secure the enjoyment of such rights as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,  
Recalling its resolution 232 (1966) of 16 December 1966, in which it determined that the situation in Southern Rhodesia constituted a threat to international peace and security,  
Cognizant of the fact that the recent acts of aggression perpetrated by the illegal regime against the People's Republic of Mozambique together with that regime's constant acts of aggression and threats against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Botswana and the Republic of Zambia aggravate the existing serious threat to the security and stability of the region,  
Recalling its resolutions on sanctions against the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia, in particular resolution 253 (1968) of 29 May 1968,  
Conscious of the important contribution made by the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique through its decision of 3 March 1976 to close its borders with Southern Rhodesia and to apply strictly sanctions against the illegal regime in conformity with United Nations resolutions,  
Deeply concerned that the measures approved by the Security Council have so far failed to bring to an end the illegal regime and convinced that sanctions cannot put an end to that regime unless they are comprehensive, mandatory and strictly supervised and unless measures are taken against States which violate them,  
Recalling its resolution 386 (1976) of 17 March 1976,  
Expressing its particular concern at the continued violation of sanctions by South Africa and its support of the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia,  
Reaffirming the primary responsibility of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as the administering Power, to take all effective measures to bring to an end the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions,  
Reaffirming the relevant provisions of the Maputo Declaration in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and in particular those provisions which call for assistance to those front-line States victims of acts of aggression by the racist minority regime,  
Affirming the right of the People's Republic of Mozambique to take all necessary measures, in accordance with the Charter, to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity,  
1.       Strongly condemns the illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia for its recent acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Mozambique;  
2.       Solemnly declares that these acts of aggression as well as the repeated attacks and threats against the Republic of Zambia and the Republic of Botswana by the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia constitute a serious aggravation of the situation in the area;  
3.       Condemns South Africa for its continued support of the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia in contravention of Security Council resolutions on sanctions against the regime at Salisbury;  
4.       Reaffirms that the continued existence of the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia is a source of insecurity and instability in the region and constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security;  
5.       Reaffirms the right of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and independence, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and urges all States to intensify assistance to the people of Zimbabwe and the national liberation movement in their struggle to achieve that objective.  
6.       Commends the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique for its scrupulous observance of sanctions against the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia and its steadfast support to the people of Zimbabwe in their legitimate struggle, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions;  
7.       Demands that the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Mozambique be scrupulously respected;  
8.       Demands that all States refrain from providing any support - overt or covert - to the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia and, in particular, demands that South Africa adhere fully to Security Council resolutions and thus cease from any co-operation or collaboration with the illegal regime at Salisbury in violation of the Council's decisions;  
9.       Requests all States to give immediate and substantial material assistance to enable the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique to strengthen its defence capability in order to safeguard effectively its sovereignty and territorial integrity;  
10.     Requests all States, regional organizations and other appropriate intergovernmental organizations to provide financial, technical and material assistance to Mozambique in order to enable it to overcome the severe economic loss and destruction of property brought about by the acts of aggression committed by the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia and to reinforce Mozambique's capacity to implement United Nations decisions in support of measure against the illegal regime;  
11.     Requests the United Nations and the organizations and programmes concerned, including the Economic and Social Council, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organization, to assist Mozambique in the fields identified in the report of the Mission to Mozambique;  
12.     Calls upon all States to implement strictly Security Council resolutions on sanctions and requests the Security Council Committee established in pursuance of resolution 253 (1968) concerning the question of Southern Rhodesia to examine as a matter of priority further effective measures to tighten the scope of sanctions in accordance with Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations and urgently to submit its appropriate recommendations to the Council;  
13.     Requests the Secretary-General to co-ordinate the efforts of the United Nations system and to organize immediately an effective programme of international assistance to Mozambique in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 10 and 11 of the present resolution;  
14.     Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
