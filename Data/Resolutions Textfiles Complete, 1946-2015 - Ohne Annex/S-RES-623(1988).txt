The Security Council,  
Having learned with grave concern of the intention of the South African authorities to implement the death sentence imposed on Mr. Paul Tefo Setlaba, an anti-apartheid activist, on the basis of so-called "common purpose",  
Strongly urges the Government of South Africa to stay execution and commute the death sentence imposed on Mr. Paul Tefo Setlaba in order to avoid further aggravating the situation in South Africa.
