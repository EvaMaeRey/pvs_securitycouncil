The Security Council,  
Convinced of the need to find an early, just and lasting peaceful solution of the Cambodia conflict,  
Noting that the Paris International Conference on Cambodia (PICC,) which met from 30 July to 30 August 1989, made progress in elaborating a wide variety of elements necessary for reaching a comprehensive political settlement,  
Taking note with appreciation of the continuing efforts of China, France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America which have resulted in the Framework for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict as contained in Security Council document S/21689,  
Taking note with appreciation also the efforts of the ASEAN countries and other countries involved in promoting the search for a comprehensive political settlement,  
Taking note further with appreciation the efforts of Indonesia and France as Co-Chairmen of the PICC and of all participants in this Conference to facilitate the restoration of peace to Cambodia,  
Noting that these efforts are aimed at enabling the Cambodian people to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination through free and fair elections organized and conducted by the United Nations in a neutral political environment with full respect for the national sovereignty of Cambodia,  
1.       Endorses the Framework for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict (S/21689) and encourages the continuing efforts of China, France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America in this regard;  
2.       Welcomes the acceptance of this framework in its entirety by all the Cambodian parties, as the basis for settling the Cambodia conflict, at the informal meeting of the Cambodian parties in Jakarta on 10 September 1990 and their commitment to it;  
3.       Further welcomes the commitment of the Cambodian parties, in full co-operation with all other participants in the PICC, to elaborating this Framework into a comprehensive political settlement through the processes of the PICC;  
4.       Welcomes, in particular, the agreement reached by all Cambodian parties in Jakarta (S/21732) forming a Supreme National Council as the unique legitimate body and source of authority in which, throughout the transitional period, the independence, national sovereignty and unity of Cambodia is embodied; 5. Urges the members of the Supreme National Council, in full accord with the framework document (S/21689), to elect the Chairman of the Council as soon as possible, so as to implement the agreement referred to in paragraph 4;  
6.       Notes that the Supreme National Council will therefore represent Cambodia externally and it is to designate its representatives to occupy the seat of Cambodia at the United Nations, in the United Nations specialized agencies, and in other international institutions and international conferences;  
7.       Urges all parties to the conflict to exercise maximum self-restraint so as to create the peaceful climate required to facilitate the achievement and the implementation of a comprehensive political settlement;  
8.       Calls upon the Co-Chairmen of the PICC to intensify their consultations with a view to reconvening the Conference, whose task will be to elaborate and adopt the comprehensive political settlement and draw up a detailed plan of implementation in accord with this framework;  
9.       Urges the Supreme National Council, all Cambodians as well as all parties to the conflict to co-operate fully in this process;  
10.     Encourages the Secretary-General to continue, within the context of preparations for reconvening the PICC and on the basis of the present resolution, preparatory studies to assess the resource implications, timing and other considerations relevant to the United Nations role;  
11.     Calls upon all States to support the achievement of a comprehensive political settlement as outlined in this framework.
