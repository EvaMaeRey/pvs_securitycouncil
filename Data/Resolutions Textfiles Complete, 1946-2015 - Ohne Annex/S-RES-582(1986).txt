The Security Council,  
Having considered the question entitled "The situation between Iran and Iraq",  
Recalling that the Security Council has been seized with the question of the situation between Iran and Iraq for almost six years and that decisions have been taken thereon,  
Deeply concerned about the prolongation of the conflict between the two countries resulting in heavy losses of human lives and considerable material damage and endangering peace and security,  
Recalling the provisions of the Charter and in particular the obligation of all members to settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered,  
Noting that both Iran and Iraq are parties to the Protocol for the prohibition of the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of bacteriological methods of warfare done at Geneva on 17 June 1925,  
Emphasizing the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force,  
Taking note of the efforts of mediation pursued by the Secretary-General,  
1.       Deplores the initial acts which gave rise to the conflict between Iran and Iraq and deplores the continuation of the conflict;  
2.       Also deplores the escalation of the conflict, especially territorial incursions, the bombing of purely civilian centres, attacks on neutral shipping or civilian aircraft, the violation of international humanitarian law and other laws of armed conflict and, in particular, the use of chemical weapons contrary to obligations under the 1925 Geneva Protocol;  
3.       Calls upon Iran and Iraq to observe an immediate cease-fire, a cessation of all hostilities on land, at sea and in the air and withdrawal of all forces to the internationally recognized boundaries without delay;  
4.       Urges that a comprehensive exchange of prisoners-of-war be completed within a short period after the cessation of hostilities in co-operation with the International Committee of the Red Cross;  
5.       Calls upon both parties to submit immediately all aspects of the conflict to mediation or to any other means of peaceful settlement of disputes;  
6.       Requests the Secretary-General to continue his ongoing efforts, to assist the two parties to give effect to this resolution and to keep the Council informed;  
7.       Calls upon all other States to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from any act which may lead to a further escalation and widening of the conflict and, thus, to facilitate the implementation of the present resolution;  
8.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
