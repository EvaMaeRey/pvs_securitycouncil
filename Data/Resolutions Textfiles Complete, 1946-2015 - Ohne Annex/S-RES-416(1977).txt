The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolutions 338 (1973) of 22 October, 340 (1973) of 25 October and 341 (1973) of 27 October 1973, 346 (1974) of 8 April and 362 (1974) of 23 October 1974, 368 (1975) of 17 April, 371 (1975) of 24 July and 378 (1975) of 23 October 1975, and 396 (1976) of 22 October 1976,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Emergency Force,  
Having noted the developments in the situation in the Middle East,  
Recalling the Secretary-General's view that any relaxation of the search for a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem could be dangerous and his hope that urgent efforts would be undertaken by all concerned to tackle the Middle East problem in all its aspects with a view both to maintaining quiet in the region and to arriving at the comprehensive settlement called for by the Security Council in its resolution 338 (1973),  
Noting that the Secretary-General recommends the extension of the mandate of the Force for one year,  
1.       Decides: (a) To call upon all the parties concerned to implement immediately Security Council resolution 338 (1973); (b) To renew the mandate of the United Nations Emergency Force for a period of one year, that is, until 24 October 1978; (c) To request the Secretary-General to submit at the end of this period a report on the developments in the situation and on the steps taken to implement resolution 338 (1973);  
2.       Expresses its confidence that the Force will be maintained with maximum efficiency and economy.
