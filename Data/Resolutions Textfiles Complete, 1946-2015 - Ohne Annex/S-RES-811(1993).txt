The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolutions 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, 747 (1992) of 24 March 1992, 785 (1992) of 30 October 1992, 793 (1992) of 30 November 1992 and 804 (1993) of 29 January 1993,  
Gravely disturbed by the recent outbreak of heavy fighting in many parts of Angola, the large number of casualties and massive loss of human life which have ensued and the further deterioration of the already dangerous political and military situation, bringing the country to the verge of the resumption of civil war,  
Gravely concerned at the persistent violations by UNITA of the major provisions of the "Acordos de Paz para Angola",  
Further concerned at reports that military support and equipment continue to flow in contravention of the "Acordos de Paz",  
Noting with particular concern that a humanitarian tragedy of grave proportions is developing in Angola and the need, therefore, for increased international humanitarian assistance,  
Deeply regretting that the second meeting between the delegations of the Government of Angola and UNITA, which had been scheduled to be held on 26 February 1993 in Addis Ababa under the auspices of the United Nations, did not take place because of the failure by UNITA to fulfil its commitment to send a delegation to Addis Ababa,  
Noting with satisfaction the readiness displayed by the Government of Angola to participate in the Addis Ababa meeting,  
Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Angola,  
Welcoming and supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative aimed at resolving the present crisis through negotiations,  
1.       Strongly condemns the persistent violations by UNITA of the major provisions of the "Acordos de Paz", in particular the continued rejection by UNITA of the results of the elections held on 29 and 30 September 1992 which the Special Representative of the Secretary-General determined as generally free and fair, its failure to take part in the political institutions established on the basis of those elections, its failure to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Government of Angola, its withdrawal from the new Angolan armed forces, its seizure by force of provincial capitals and municipalities and the resumption of hostilities;  
2.       Demands that UNITA accept unreservedly the results of the democratic elections of 1992 and abide fully by the "Acordos de Paz", and further demands that the two parties, particularly UNITA, produce early evidence, not later than 30 March 1993, that real progress has been made towards the implementation of the "Acordos de Paz";  
3.       Strongly demands an immediate cease-fire throughout the country, and further demands the resumption without delay and without preconditions of a continued and meaningful dialogue under United Nations auspices so that a clear time-table for the completion of the implementation of the "Acordos de Paz" may be established;  
4.       Reaffirms that it will hold responsible any party which refuses to take part in such a dialogue, thereby jeopardizing the entire process, and will consider all appropriate measures under the Charter of the United Nations to advance the implementation of the "Acordos de Paz";  
5.       Strongly condemns verbal and physical attacks against the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and UNAVEM II personnel in Angola, and demands that these attacks cease forthwith and that the Government of Angola and UNITA take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and security;  
6.       Condemns the kidnapping of a UNAVEM II military observer in Cabinda on 23 February 1993 and demands that he be released unharmed and unconditionally and without further delay;  
7.       Supports fully the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in their continuing efforts to restore the peace process and to carry out the mandate of UNAVEM II under extremely difficult conditions;  
8.       Invites the Secretary-General to seek to organize a meeting between the Government of Angola and UNITA at the highest possible level with a view to securing the full implementation of the "Acordos de Paz", this meeting to take place in good time before 30 April 1993 and to consider also the future role of the United Nations in Angola, and encourages the parties to respond positively;  
9.       Requests the Secretary-General, pending the submission of the report referred to in paragraph 16 of resolution 804 (1993) , to present as soon as possible a progress report on the efforts for the resumption of the talks between the two parties in Angola at all appropriate levels;  
10.     Calls on all Member States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to accord or increase humanitarian relief assistance to Angola and encourages the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, with the resources at her disposal, to coordinate the provision of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population in need;  
11.     Strongly appeals to both parties strictly to abide by applicable rules of international humanitarian law, including unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance to the civilian population in need;  
12.     Appeals once again to all Member States to render economic, material and technical assistance to the Government of Angola for the reconstruction and development of the country;  
13.     Looks forward to the report of the Secretary-General referred to in paragraph 16 of resolution 804 (1993) on the situation in Angola together with his recommendations for the further role of the United Nations in the peace process;  
14.     Decides to remain seized of the matter.
