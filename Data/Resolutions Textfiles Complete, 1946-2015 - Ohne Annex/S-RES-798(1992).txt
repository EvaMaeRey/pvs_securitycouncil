Recalling its resolution 770 (1992) and 771 (1992) of 13 August 1992 as well as other relevant resolutions of the Security Council,  
Appalled by reports of the massive, organized and systematic detention and rape of women, in particular Muslim women, in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Taking note of the intiative taken by the European Council on the rapid dispatch of a delegation to investigate the facts received until now,

4.       Requests the member States of the European Community to inform the Secretary-General of the work of the delegation;  
5.       Invites the Secretary-General to report to it within fifteen days of the adoption of the present resolution on measures taken to support the delegation;
