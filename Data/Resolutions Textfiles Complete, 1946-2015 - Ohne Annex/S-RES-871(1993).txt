The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolution 743 (1992) and all subsequent resolutions relating to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR),  
Reaffirming also its resolution 713 (1991) and all subsequent relevant resolutions,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 20 September 1993 (S/26470 and Add.1),  
Having also considered the letter of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Croatia dated 24 September 1993 (S/26491, annex),  
Deeply concerned that the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia (S/23280, annex III), and all relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 769 (1992) , have not yet been fully implemented,  
Reiterating its determination to ensure the security of UNPROFOR and its freedom of movement for all its missions, and to these ends, as regards UNPROFOR in the Republic of Croatia and in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  
1.       Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General of 20 September 1993 (S/26470), in particular its paragraph 16;  
2.       Takes note of the intention of the Secretary-General to establish, as described in his report, three subordinate commands within UNPROFOR -- UNPROFOR (Croatia), UNPROFOR (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and UNPROFOR (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) -- while retaining the existing dispositions in all other respects for the direction and conduct of the United Nations operation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia;  
3.       Condemns once again continuing military attacks within the territory of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and reaffirms its commitment to ensure respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where UNPROFOR is deployed.  
4.       Reaffirms the crucial importance of the full and prompt implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia including the provisions of the plan concerning the demilitarization of the United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) and calls upon the signatories of that plan and all others concerned, in particular the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), to cooperate in its full implementation;  
5.       Declares that continued non-cooperation in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council or external interference, in respect of the full implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia would have serious consequences and in this connection affirms that full normalization of the international community's position towards those concerned will take into account their actions in implementing all relevant resolutions of the Security Council including those relating to the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia;  
6.       Calls for an immediate cease-fire agreement between the Croatian Government and the local Serb authorities in the UNPAs, mediated under the auspices of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, and urges them to cooperate fully and unconditionally in its implementation, as well as in the implementation of all the relevant resolutions of the Council;  
7.       Stresses the importance it attaches, as a first step towards the implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia, to the process of restoration of the authority of the Republic of Croatia in the pink zones, and in this context calls for the revival of the Joint Commission established under the chairmanship of UNPROFOR;  
8.       Urges all the parties and others concerned to cooperate with UNPROFOR in reaching and implementing an agreement on confidence-building measures including the restoration of electricity, water and communications in all regions of the Republic of Croatia, and stresses in this context the importance it attaches to the opening of the railroad between Zagreb and Split, the highway between Zagreb and Zupanja, and the Adriatic oil pipeline, securing the uninterrupted traffic across the Maslenica strait, and restoring the supply of electricity and water to all regions of the Republic of Croatia including the United Nations Protected Areas;  
9.       Authorizes UNPROFOR, in carrying out its mandate in the Republic of Croatia, acting in self-defence, to take the necessary measures, including the use of force, to ensure its security and its freedom of movement;  
10.     Decides to continue to review urgently the extension of close air support to UNPROFOR in the territory of the Republic of Croatia as recommended by the Secretary-General in his report of 20 September 1993 (S/26470);  
11.     Decides in this context to extend UNPROFOR's mandate for an additional period terminating on 31 March 1994;  
12.     Requests the Secretary-General to report two months after the adoption of the present resolution on progress towards implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia and all relevant Security Council resolutions, taking into account the position of the Croatian Government, as well as on the outcome of the negotiations within the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, and decides to reconsider UNPROFOR's mandate in the light of that report;  
13.     Requests further the Secretary-General to keep the Council regularly informed on developments in regard to the implementation of UNPROFOR's mandate;  
14.     Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
