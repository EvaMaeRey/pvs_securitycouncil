The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolutions 503 (1982) , 525 (1982) , 522 (1982) and 547 (1984) which, inter alia, expressed its grave concern that the Pretoria regime's practice of sentencing to death and executing its opponents has adverse consequences on the search for a peaceful resolution of the South African situation,  
Gravely concerned at the deteriorating situation in South Africa, the worsening human suffering resulting from the apartheid system and, inter alia, the South African regime's renewed state of emergency, its imposition of severe restrictions on 18 anti-apartheid and labour organizations and 18 individuals committed to peaceful forms of struggle on 24 February 1988 and the harassment and detention of church leaders on 29 February 1988, all of which further undermine the possibilities of a peaceful resolution of the South African situation,  
Having considered the question of the death sentences passed on 12 December 1985 in South Africa on Mojalefa Reginald Sefatsa, Reid Malebo Mokoena, Oupa Moses Diniso, Theresa Ramashamola, Duma Joseph Khumalo and Francis Don Mokhesi, known as the Sharpeville Six, as well as the decision to execute them on Friday, 18 March 1988,  
Conscious that the Court proceedings of the Sharpeville Six show that none of the six young South Africans convicted of murder were found by the Court to have caused the actual death of the Councillor and that they were convicted of murder and sentenced to death only because the Court found that they had a "common purpose" with the actual perpetrators,  
Deeply concerned at the Pretoria regime's decision to execute the Sharpeville Six on Friday, 18 March 1988, in defiance of world-wide appeals,  
Convinced that these executions, if carried out, will further inflame an already grave situation in South Africa,  
1.       Calls upon the South African authorities to stay execution and commute the death sentence imposed on the Sharpeville Six;  
2.       Urges all States and organizations to use their influence and take urgent measures, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, the resolutions of the Security Council and relevant instruments, to save the lives of the Sharpeville Six.
