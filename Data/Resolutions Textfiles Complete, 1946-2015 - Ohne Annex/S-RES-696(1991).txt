Welcoming the decision of the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola to conclude the 'Accordos de Paz para Angola',  
Stressing the importance it attaches to the signing of the 'Acordos de Paz para Angola' and to the fulfilment by the parties in good faith of the obligations contained therein,  
Stressing further the importance of all States refraining from taking any actions which could undermine the agreements mentioned above and contributing to their implementation as well as respecting fully the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola,  
Noting with satisfaction the decision taken by the Governments of the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Cuba to complete the withdrawal, ahead of schedule, of all Cuban troops from Angola by 25 May 1991 (S/22644),
