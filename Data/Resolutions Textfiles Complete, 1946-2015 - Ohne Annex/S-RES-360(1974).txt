Noting that all States have declared their respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus,  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in Cyprus, resulting from the further military operations, which constituted a most serious threat to peace and security in the East Mediterranean area,

2.       Urges the parties to comply with all the provisions of previous resolutions of the Security Council, including those concerning the withdrawal without delay from the Republic of Cyprus of foreign military personnel present otherwise than under the authority of international agreements;  
3.       Urges the parties to resume without delay, in an atmosphere of constructive co-operation, the negotiations called for in resolution 353 (1974) , whose outcome should not be impeded or prejudged by the acquisition of advantages resulting from military operations;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council, as necessary, with a view to the possible adoption of further measures designed to promote the restoration of peaceful conditions;  
5.       Decides to remain seized of the question permanently and to meet at any time to consider measures which may be required in the light of the developing situation.
