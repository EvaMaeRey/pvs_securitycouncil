The Security Council,  
Having considered the question concerning the inclusion of Arabic among the official and working languages of the Security Council,  
Bearing in mind General Assembly resolution 35/219 of 17 December 1980,  
Bearing also in mind General Assembly resolutions 3190 (XXVIII) of 18 December 1973 and 34/226 of 20 December 1979,  
Taking into account that the General Assembly, in its resolution 35/219, after affirming that, in the interest of the full effectiveness of the work of the United Nations, Arabic should be accorded the same status as the other official and working languages, requested, inter alia, the Security Council to include Arabic among its official and working languages no later than 1 January 1983,

Rule 41  
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish shall be both the official and the working languages of the Security Council.
