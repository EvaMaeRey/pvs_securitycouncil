The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolutions 607 (1988) of 5 January 1988 and 608 (1988) of 14 January 1988,  
Having been apprised that Israel, the occupying Power, has once again, in defiance of those resolutions, deported eight Palestinian civilians on 29 June 1989,  
Expressing grave concern over the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories,  
Recalling the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular articles 47 and 49 thereof,  
1.       Deeply regrets the continuing deportation by Israel, the occupying Power, of Palestinian civilians;  
2.       Calls upon Israel to ensure the safe and immediate return to the occupied Palestinian territories of those deported and to desist forthwith from deporting any other Palestinian civilians;  
3.       Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, is applicable to the Palestinian territories, occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem, and to the other occupied Arab territories;  
4.       Decides to keep the situation under review.
