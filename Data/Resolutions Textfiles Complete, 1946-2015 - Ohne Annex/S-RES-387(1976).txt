The Security Council,  
Having considered the letter of the Permanent Representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group of States at the United Nations,  
Having heard the statement of the representative of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Recalling the principle that no State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State,  
Recalling also the inherent and lawful right of every State, in the exercise of its sovereignty, to request assistance from any other State or group of States,  
Bearing in mind that all Member States must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,  
Gravely concerned at the acts of aggression committed by South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola and the violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity,  
Condemning the utilization by South Africa of the internatioial Territory of Namibia to mount that aggression,  
Gravely concerned also at the damage and destruction done by the South African invading forces in Angola and by their seizure of Angolan equipment and materials,  
Noting the letter of the Permanent Representative of South Africa regarding the withdrawal of South African troops,  
1.       Condemns South Africa's aggression against the People's Republic of Angola;  
2.       Demands that South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola;  
3.       Demands also that South Africa desist from the utilization of the international Territory of Namibia to mount provocative or aggressive acts against the People's Republic of Angola or any other neighbouring African State;  
4.       Calls upon the Government of South Africa to meet the just claims of the People's Republic of Angola for a full compensation of the damage and destruction inflicted on its State and for the restoration of the equipment and materials which its invading forces seized;  
5.       Requests the Secretary-General to follow the implementation of the present resolution.
