The Security Council,  
Having considered the request by the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations contained in document S/17474,  
Having heard the statement of the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of Angola to the United Nations,  
Recalling its resolutions 387 (1976) of 31 March 1976, 428 (1978) of 6 May 1978, 447 (1979) of 28 March 1979, 454 (1979) of 2 November 1979, 475 (1980) of 27 June 1980, 545 (1983) of 20 December 1983, 567 (1985) of 20 June 1985, which, inter alia, condemned South Africa's aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and demanded that South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Gravely concerned at the further renewed escalation of hostile, unprovoked and persistent acts of aggression and sustained armed invasions committed by the racist regime of South Africa, in violation of the sovereignty, airspace and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Convinced that the intensity and timing of these acts of armed invasions are intended to frustrate efforts at negotiated settlements in southern Africa, particularly in regard to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) ,  
Grieved at the tragic loss of human life, mainly that of civilians and concerned about the damage and destruction of property including bridges and livestock resulting from the escalated acts of aggression and armed incursions by the racist regime of South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola,  
Gravely concerned that these wanton acts of aggression by South Africa form a consistent and sustained pattern of violations and are aimed at weakening the unrelenting support of Front-line States for the movements for freedom and national liberation of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa,  
Conscious of the need to take effective steps for the prevention and removal of all threats to international peace and security posed by South Africa's military attacks,  
1.       Strongly condemns the racist regime of South Africa for its premeditated, persistent and sustained armed invasions of the People's Republic of Angola, which constitute a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of this country, as well as a serious threat to international peace and security; 2. Strongly condemns also South Africa for its utilization of the international territory of Namibia as a springboard for perpetrating armed invasions and destabilization of the People's Republic of Angola;  
3.       Demands that South Africa withdraw forthwith and unconditionally all its military forces from the territory of the People's Republic of Angola, cease all acts of aggression against that State and scrupulously respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola;  
4.       Calls upon all State to implement fully the arms embargo imposed against South Africa in resolution 418 (1977) of 4 November 1977;  
5.       Requests Member States urgently to extend all necessary assistance to the People's Republic of Angola and other Front-line States, in order to strengthen their defence capacity against South Africa's acts of aggression;  
6.       Calls for payment of full and adequate compensation to the People's Republic of Angola for the damage to life and property resulting from these acts of aggression;  
7.       Decides to appoint and send immediately to Angola a Commission of Investigation, comprising three members of the Security Council, in order to evaluate the damage resulting from the invasion by South African forces and to report to the Council not later than 15 November 1985;  
8.       Urges Member States, pending the report of the Commission of Investigation, to take prompt, appropriate and effective action to bring pressure to bear upon the Government of South Africa to comply with the provisions of the present resolution and of the United Nations Charter, to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola, and to desist from all acts of aggression against neighbouring States;  
9.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
