The Security Council,  
Recalling resolution 473 (1980) and its statement of 5 February 1981 (S/14361) regarding the death sentences passed by the Transvaal Division of the Supreme Court in Pretoria on Ncimbiti Johnson Lubisi, Petrus Tsepo Mashigo and Naphtali Namana, three members of the African National Congress of South Africa,  
Gravely concerned over the confirmation of the death sentences by the South African Court of Appeal on 7 April 1982,  
Deeply concerned that the carrying out of the death sentences would further aggravate the situation in South Africa,  
1.       Calls upon the South African authorities to commute the death sentences;  
2.       Urges all States and organizations to use their influence and to take urgent measures in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, the resolutions of the Security Council and relevant international instruments to save the lives of these three men.
