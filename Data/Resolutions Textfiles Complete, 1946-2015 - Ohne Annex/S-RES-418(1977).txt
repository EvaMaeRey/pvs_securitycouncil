The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolutions 392 (1976) of 19 June 1976, strongly condemning the racist regime of South Africa for its resort to massive violence against and wanton killings of the African people, including schoolchildren and students and others opposing racial discrimination, and calling upon the South African racist regime urgently to end violence against the African people and to take urgent steps to eliminate apartheid and racial discrimination,  
Recognizing that the military build-up by South Africa and its persistent acts of aggression against the neighbouring States seriously disturb the security of those States,  
Further recognizing that the existing arms embargo must be strengthened and universally applied, without any reservations or qualifications whatsoever, in order to prevent a further aggravation of the grave situation in South Africa,  
Taking note of the Lagos Declaration for Action against Apartheid,  
Gravely concerned that South Africa is at the threshhold of producing nuclear weapons,  
Strongly condemning the South African Government for its acts of repression, its defiant continuance of the system of apartheid and its attacks against neighbouring independent States,  
Considering that the policies and acts of the South African Government are fraught with danger to international peace and security,  
Recalling its resolutiom 181 (1963) of 7 August 1963 and other resolutions concerning a voluntary arms embargo against South Africa,  
Convinced that a mandatory arms embargo needs to be universally applied against South Africa in the first instance,  
Acting therefore under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  
1.       Determines, having regard to the policies and acts of the South African Government, that the acquisition by South Africa of arms and related material constitutes a threat to the maintenance of international peace and security;  
2.       Decides that all States shall cease forthwith any provision to South Africa of arms and related material of all types, including the sale or transfer of weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, para-military police equipment, and spare parts for the aforementioned, and shall cease as well the provision of all types of equipment and supplies and grants of licensing arrangements for the manufacture or maintenance of the aforementioned;  
3.       Calls upon all States to review, having regard to the objectives of the present resolution, all existing contractual arrangements with and licenses granted to South Africa relating to the manufacture and maintenance of arms, ammunition of all types and military equipment and vehicles, with a view to terminating them;  
4.       Further decides that all States shall refrain from any co-operation with South Africa in the manufacture and development of nuclear weapons;  
5.       Calls upon all States, including States non-members of the United Nations, to act strictly in accordance with the provisions of the present resolution;  
6.       Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on the progress of the implementation of the present resolutions, the first report to be submitted not later than 1 May 1978;  
7.       Decides to keep this item on its agenda for further action, as appropriate, in the light of developments.
