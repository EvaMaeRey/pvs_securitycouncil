Recalling the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and in particular article 1, which reads "The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances," and article 49, which reads "Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive;",  
1.       Strongly deplores the failure of the Government of Israel to implement Security Council resolution 468 (1980) of 8 May 1980;  
2.       Calls again upon the Government of Israel, as occupying Power, to rescind the illegal measures taken by the Israeli military occupation authorities in expelling the mayors of Hebron and Halhoul and the Sharia Judge of Hebron, and to facilitate the immediate return of the expelled Palestinian leaders, so that they can resume their functions for which they were elected and appointed;  
3.       Commends the Secretary-General for his efforts and requests him to continue his efforts in order to ensure the immediate implementation of this resolution and to report to the Security Council on the result of his efforts at the earliest possible date.
