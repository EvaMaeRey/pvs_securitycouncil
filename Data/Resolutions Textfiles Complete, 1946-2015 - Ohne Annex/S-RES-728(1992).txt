The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolutions 668 (1990) of 20 September 1990, 717 (1991) of 16 October 1991 and 718 (1991) of 31 October 1991,  
Welcoming the fact that the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC) has become operational as reported by the Secretary-General in his report of 14 November 1991 (S/23218),  
Welcoming also the progress that has been made in implementing the provisions of the Agreements on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict (S/23177, annex) relating to the functioning of the Supreme National Council of Cambodia under the chairmanship of His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and the maintenance of the cease-fire,  
Concerned that the existence of mines and minefields in Cambodia poses a serious hazard to the safety of people in Cambodia, as well as an obstacle to the smooth and timely implementation of the Agreements on the Comprehensive Political Settlement, including the early return of Cambodia refugees and displaced persons,  
Noting that UNAMIC's mandate as approved by the Security Council in its resolution 717 (1991) provides, inter alia, for the establishment of a mine awareness programme, and that the Agreements provide for the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to undertake, inter alia, a programme of assisting with clearing mines and undertaking training programmes in mine clearance and a mine awareness programme among the Cambodian people,  
Considering that the establishment of training programmes in mine clearance, in addition to the existing mine awareness programme undertaken by UNAMIC, and the early initiation of mine clearance are required for the effective implementation of the Agreements on the Comprehensive Settlement,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General proposing that the mandate of UNAMIC be expanded to include training in mine clearance and the initiation of a mine clearance programme (S/23331),  
1.       Approves the report of the Secretary-General (S/23331), especially the provision of assistance in mine clearing by Cambodians;  
2.       Calls upon the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, and all the Cambodian parties, to continue to cooperate fully with the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia, including in the discharge of its expanded mandate;  
3.       Reiterates its call to all the Cambodian parties to comply scrupulously with the cease-fire and to lend all necessary assistance to UNAMIC;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General to keep the Security Council informed of further developments.
