Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Emergency Force,  
Recalling the Secretary-General's view that the situation in the Middle East as a whole continues to be unstable and potentially dangerous and is likely to remain so unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can be reached, and his hope that urgent efforts will be pursued by all concerned to tackle the problem in all its aspects, with a view both to maintaining quiet in the region and to arriving at a just and durable peace settlement, as called for by the Security Council in its resolution 338 (1973),  
1.       Decides to renew the mandate of the United Nations Emergency Force for a period of nine months, that is, until 24 July 1979;  
2.       Requests the Secretary-General to submit at the end of this period a report on the developments in the situation and on the steps taken to implement Security Council resolution 338 (1973);  
3.       Expresses its confidence that the Force will be maintained with maximum efficiency and economy.
