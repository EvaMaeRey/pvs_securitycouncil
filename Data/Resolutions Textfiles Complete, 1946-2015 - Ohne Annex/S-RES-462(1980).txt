The Security Council,  
Having considered the item on the agenda of its 2185th meeting, as contained in document S/Agenda/2185,  
Taking into account that the lack of unanimity of its permanent members at the 2190th meeting of the Security Council has prevented it from exercising its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,  
Decides to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly to examine the question contained in document S/Agenda/2185.
