The Security Council,  
Having considered the question of the death sentences passed on 6 August 1982 in South Africa on Mr. Thelle Simon Mogoerane, Mr. Jerry Semano Mosololi and Mr. Marcus Thabo Motaung, members of the African National Congress of South Africa,  
Recalling its statement of 4 October 1982 (S/15444) as well as its resolution 525 (1982) of 7 December 1982 appealing for executive clemency in this case,  
Gravely concerned over the decision of the South African authorities on 6 June 1983 to refuse executive clemency in respect of the three men,  
Conscious that the carrying out of the death sentences will aggravate the situation in South Africa,  
1.       Calls upon the South African authorities to commute the death sentences imposed on the three men,  
2.       Urges all States and organizations to use their influence and to take urgent measures, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, the resolutions of the Security Council and relevant international instruments, to save the lives of the three men.
