The Security Council,  
Having considered the report of 25 April 1988 (S/19823) of the Mission dispatched by the Secretary-General to investigate allegations of the use of chemical weapons in the conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq,  
Dismayed by the Mission's conclusions that chemical weapons continue to be used in the conflict and that their use has been on an even more intensive scale than before,  
1.       Affirms the urgent necessity of strict observance of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925;  
2.       Condemns vigorously the continued use of chemical weapons in the conflict between Iran and Iraq contrary to the obligations under the Geneva Protocol;  
3.       Expects both sides to refrain from the future use of chemical weapons in accordance with their obligations under the Geneva Protocol;  
4.       Calls upon all States to continue to apply or to establish strict control of the export to the parties to the conflict of chemical products serving for the production of chemical weapons;  
5.       Decides to remain seized of the matter and expresses its determination to review the implementation of this resolution.
