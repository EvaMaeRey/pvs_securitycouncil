Noting that the Government of Cyprus has agreed that in view of the prevailing conditions in the island it is necessary to continue the Force beyond 15 June 1970,

3.         Extends once more the stationing in Cyprus of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force, established under Security Council resolution 186 (1964), for a further period ending 15 December 1970, in the expectation that by then sufficient progress towards a final solution will make possible a withdrawal or substantial reduction of the Force.
