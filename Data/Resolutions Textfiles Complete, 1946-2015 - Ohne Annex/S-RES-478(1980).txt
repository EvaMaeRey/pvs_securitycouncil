The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolution 476 (1980) of 30 June 1980,  
Reaffirming again that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible,  
Deeply concerned over the enactment of a "basic law" in the Israeli Knesset proclaiming a change in the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, with its implications for peace and security,  
Noting that Israel has not complied with Security Council resolution 476 (1980) ,  
Reaffirming its determination to examine practical ways and means, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, to secure the full implementation of its resolution 476 (1980) , in the event of non-compliance by Israel,  
1.       Censures in the strongest terms the enactment by Israel of the "basic law" on Jerusalem and the refusal to comply with relevant Security Council resolutions;  
2.       Affirms that the enactment of the "basic law" by Israel constitutes a violation of international law and does not affect the continued application of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since June 1967, including Jerusalem;  
3.       Determines that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, which have altered or purport to alter the character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and, in particular, the recent "basic law" on Jerusalem, are null and void and must be rescinded forthwith;  
4.       Affirms also that this action constitutes a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East;  
5.       Decides not to recognise the "basic law" and such other actions by Israel that, as a result of this law, seek to alter the character and status of Jerusalem and calls upon all Members of the United Nations: (a) to accept this decision; (b) and upon those States that have established diplomatic Missions in Jerusalem to withdraw such Missions from the Holy City;  
6.       Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on the implementation of this resolution before 15 November 1980;  
7.       Decides to remain seized of this serious situation.
