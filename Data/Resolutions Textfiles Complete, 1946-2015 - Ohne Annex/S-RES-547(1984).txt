The Security Council,  
Having considered the question of the death sentence passed on 6 June 1983 in South Africa on Mr. Malesela Benjamin Maloise,  
Recalling its resolutions 503 (1982) of 9 April 1982, 525 (1982) of 7 December 1982 and 533 (1983) of 7 June 1983,  
Gravely concerned over the current decision of the South African authorities to reject an appeal against the death sentence imposed upon Mr. Maloise,  
Conscious of the fact that carrying out the death sentence will further aggravate the situation in South Africa,  
1.       Calls upon the South African authorities to commute the death sentence imposed upon Mr. Maloise,  
2.       Urges all States and organizations to use their influence and to take urgent measures, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, resolutions of the Security Council and relevant international instruments, to save the life of Mr. Malesela Benjamin Maloise.
