The Security Council,  
Noting with grave concern that the situation concerning Western Sahara has seriously deteriorated,  
Noting with regret that, despite its resolutions 377 (1975) of 22 October and 379 (1975) of 2 November 1975 as well as the appeal made by the President of the Security Council under its authorization, to the King of Morocco with an urgent request to put an end forthwith to the declared march on Western Saraha, the said march has taken place,  
Acting on the basis of the aforementioned resolutions,  
1.       Deplores the holding of the march;  
2.       Calls upon Morocco immediately to withdraw from the Territory of Western Sahara all the participants in the march;  
3.       Calls upon Morocco and all other parties concerned and interested, without prejudice to any action which the General Assembly might take under the terms of its resolution 3293 (XXIX) of 13 December 1974 or any negotiation which the parties concerned and interested might undertake under Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations, to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in the fulfilment of the mandate entrusted to him in Security Council resolutions 377 (1975) and 379 (1975) .
