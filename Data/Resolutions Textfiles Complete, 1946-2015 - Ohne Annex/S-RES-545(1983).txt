The Security Council,  
Having heard the statement of the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations,  
Deeply concerned at the continued occupation of parts of southern Angola by the South African military forces in flagrant violation of the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law,  
Gravely concerned at the massive loss of human life and extensive destruction of property brought about by the continuing attacks against and military occupation of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Recalling its resolutions 387 (1976) , 428 (1978) , 447 (1979) , 454 (1979) and 475 (1980) ,  
Bearing in mind that in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations, all Member States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the Charter,  
Conscious of the need to take effective measures to maintain international peace and security in view of South Africa's continued violation of the Charter of the United Nations,  
1.       Strongly condemns South Africa's continued military occupation of parts of southern Angola which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola;  
2.       Declares that the continued illegal military occupation of the territory of the People's Republic of Angola is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Angola and endangers international peace and security;  
3.       Demands that South Africa should unconditionally withdraw forthwith all its occupation forces from the territory of Angola and cease all violations against that State and henceforth scrupulously respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola;  
4.       Considers, moreover, that Angola is entitled to appropriate redress for any material damage it has suffered;  
5.       Calls upon all Member States to desist from any action which would undermine the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the People's Republic of Angola;  
6.       Requests the Secretary-General to monitor the implementation of the present resolution and report accordingly to the Security Council;  
7.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
