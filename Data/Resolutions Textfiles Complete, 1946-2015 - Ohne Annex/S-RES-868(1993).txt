Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 27 August 1993 on the security of United Nations operations (S/26358,  
Recalling the provisions of the Charter concerning privileges and immunities, and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, as applicable to United Nations operations and persons engaged in such operations,  
Expressing grave concern at the increasing number of attacks and use of force against persons engaged in United Nations operations and resolutely condemning all such actions,  
Welcoming the initiatives being taken in the General Assembly to consider the elaboration of new instruments relating to the security and safety of United Nations forces and personnel, and noting the Secretary-General's proposals in this regard,  
1.       Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General of 27 August 1993 on the security of United Nations operations (S/26358);  
2.       Encourages the Secretary-General to take forward those measures proposed in his report falling within his responsibilities with a view, in particular, to ensuring that security matters are an integral part of the planning for an operation and that any such precautions extend to all personnel engaged in such operation;  
3.       Urges States and parties to a conflict to cooperate closely with the United Nations to ensure the security and safety of United Nations forces and personnel;  
4.       Confirms that attacks and use of force against persons engaged in a United Nations operation authorized by the Security Council will be considered interference with the exercise of the responsibilities of the Council and may require the Council to consider measures it deems appropriate;  
5.       Confirms also that if, in the Council's view, the host country is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations with regard to the safety and security of a United Nations operation and personnel engaged in such operation the Council will consider what steps should be taken appropriate to the situation;  
6.       Determines that, when considering the establishment of future United Nations operations authorized by the Council, the Security Council will require inter alia:  
(a)      That the host country take all appropriate steps to ensure the security and safety of the operation and its personnel;  
(b)      That the security and safety arrangements undertaken by the host country extend to all persons engaged in the United Nations operation;  
(c)      That an agreement on the status of the operation, and all its personnel, in the host country be negotiated expeditiously and should come into force as near as possible to the outset of the operation;  
7.       Requests the Secretary-General when recommending the establishment or renewal of a United Nations operation by the Security Council to take into account the provisions of the present resolution;  
8.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
