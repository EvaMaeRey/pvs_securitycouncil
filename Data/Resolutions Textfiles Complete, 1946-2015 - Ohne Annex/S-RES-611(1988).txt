The Security Council,  
Having considered the letter dated 19 April l988 (S/19798), in which Tunisia made a complaint against Israel following the new act of aggression committed by the latter against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia,  
Having heard the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia,  
Having noted with concern that the aggression perpetrated on 16 April 1988 in the locality of Sidi Bou Said has caused loss of human life, particularly the assassination of Mr. Khalil El Wazir,  
Recalling that in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations, all Member States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or acting in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,  
Considering that in its reolution 573 (1985) , adopted following the act of aggression committed on 1 October 1985 by Israel against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia, it has condemned Israel and has demanded that Israel refrain from perpetrating such acts of aggression or from threatening to do so,  
Gravely concerned by the act of aggression which constitutes a serious and renewed threat to peace, security and stability in the Mediterranean region,  
1.       Condemns vigorously the aggression perpetrated on 16 April 1988 against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and norms of conduct;  
2.       Urges Member states to take measures to prevent such acts against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States;  
3.       Expresses its determination to take the appropriate steps to ensure the implementation of the present resolution;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General to report urgently to the Security Council any new elements available to him and relating to this aggression;  
5.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
