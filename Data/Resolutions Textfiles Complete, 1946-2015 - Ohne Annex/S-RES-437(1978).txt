The Security Council,  
Having considered the letter 6 October 1978 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established in pursuance of resolution 253 (1968) concerning the question of Southern Rhodesia,  
Recalling its resolution 253 (1968) of 29 May 1968, by which it made it mandatory for Member States to prevent the entry into their territories of persons ordinarily resident in Southern Rhodesia and connected with the illegal regime there,  
Taking note of the statement of the African Group,  
Taking note also of the statement of the Government of the United States of America,  
1.       Notes with regret and concern the decision of the Government of the United States of America to allow the entry into the United States of Ian Smith and some members of the illegal regime in Southern Africa,  
2.       Considers that the above-mentioned decision is in contravention of Security Council resolution 253 (1969) and of the obligations under Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations;  
3.       Calls upon the United States of America to observe scrupulously the provisions of Security Council resolutions concerning sanctions;  
4.       Expresses the hope that the United States of America will continue to exert its influence in order that genuine majority rule may be achieved without further delay in Southern Rhodesia.
