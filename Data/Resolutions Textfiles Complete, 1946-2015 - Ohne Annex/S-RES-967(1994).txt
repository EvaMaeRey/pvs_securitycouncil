The Security Council,  
Recalling all its previous relevant resolutions on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and in particular its resolution 757 (1992) of 30 May 1992,  
Taking note of the letter of the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 724 (1991) concerning Yugoslavia of 14 December 1994 (S/1994/1418) and the communication of the Acting Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund of 13 December 1994 annexed thereto in which the Council is informed of a major resurgence of diphtheria, and that the only available stocks of anti-serum to combat this serious condition are located in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),  
Recognizing that the export of anti-serum from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) will require an exemption from the provisions of resolution 757 (1992) of 30 May 1992 and acting, in this respect, under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  
1.       Decides to permit, for a period of thirty days from the date of the adoption of this resolution, the export of 12,000 vials of diphtheria anti-serum from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro);  
2.       Decides further that any payments for such authorized shipments shall be made only into frozen accounts;  
3.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
