The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolutions on the question of Southern Rhodesia, and in particular resolutions 253 (1968), 403 (1977) , 411 (1977) , 423 (1978) , 437 (1978) and 445 (1979) reaffirming the illegality of the Smith regime,  
Having heard the statement of the Chairman of the African Group,  
Having also heard the statement of the representative of the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe,  
Reaffirming Security Council resolution 445 (1979) , particularly its provision declaring any elections held under the auspices of the illegal racist regime and the results thereof null and void and that no recognition will be accorded either by the United Nations or any Member State to any representative or organ established by that process,  
Gravely concerned that the illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia proceeded with the holding of sham elections in the territory in utter defiance of the United Nations,  
Convinced that these so-called elections did not constitute a genuine exercise of the right of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and national independence and were designed to perpetuate white racist minority rule,  
Reaffirming the inalienable right of the people of Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) to self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and the legitmacy of their struggle to secure the enjoyment of such rights as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,  
Bearing in mind the responsibility of every Member State to adhere scrupulously to Security Council resolutions and decisions, and their responsibility to ensure that institutions and citizens under their jurisdiction observe the same,  
1.       Strongly condemns all attempts and manoeuvres by the illegal regime including the so-called elections of April 1979 aimed at retaining and extending a racist minority rule and at preventing the accession of Zimbabwe to independence and genuine majority rule;  
2.       Reaffirms the so-called elections, held under the auspices of the illegal racist regime, and the results thereof, as null and void;  
3.       Reiterates its call to all States not to accord recognition to any representative of or organ established by that process and to observe strictly the mandatory sanctions against Southern Rhodesia.
