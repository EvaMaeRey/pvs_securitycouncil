The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolutions 338 (1973) of 22 October, 340 (1973) of 25 October and 341 (1973) of 27 October 1973, 346 (1974) of 8 April and 362 (1974) of 23 October 1974, 368 (1975) of 17 April and 371 (1975) of 24 July 1975,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Emergency Force,  
Having noted the development in the situation in the Middle East,  
Having further noted the Secretary-General's view that any relaxation of the search for a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem could be especially dangerous in the months to come and that it is his hope, therefore, that urgent efforts will be undertaken by all concerned to tackle the Middle East problem in all its aspects, with a view both to maintaining quiet in the region and to arriving at the comprehensive settlement called for by the Security Council in its resolution 338 (1973),  
Decides: (a) To call upon the parties concerned to implement immediately Security Council resolution 338 (1973); (b) To renew the mandate of the United Nations Emergency Force for a period of one year, that is, until 24 October 1976; (c) To request the Secretary-General to submit at the end of this period a report on the developments in the situation and the steps taken to implement resolution 338 (1973).
