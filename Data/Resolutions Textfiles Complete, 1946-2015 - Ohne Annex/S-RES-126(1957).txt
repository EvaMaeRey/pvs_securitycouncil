The Security Council,  
Having received and noted with appreciation the report of Mr. Gunnar V. Jarring, the representative of Sweden,6 on the mission undertaken by him pursuant to its resolution 123 (1957) of 21 February 1957,  
Expressing its thanks to Mr. Jarring for the care and ability with which he has carried out his mission,  
Observing with appreciation the expressions made by both parties of sincere willingness to co-operate with the United Nations in finding a peaceful solution,  
Observing further that the Governments of India and Pakistan recognize and accept the provisions of its resolution 38 (1948) of 17 January 1948 and of the resolutions of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan dated 13 August 19487 and 5 January 1949,8 which envisage in accordance with their terms the determination of the future status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the will of the people through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite, and that Mr. Jarring felt it appropriate to explore what was impeding their full implementation,  
Concerned over the lack of progress towards a settlement of the dispute which his report manifests,  
Considering the importance which it has attached to demilitarization of the State of Jammu and Kashmir as one of the steps towards a settlement,  
Recalling its previous resolutions and the resolutions of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan on the India-Pakistan question,  
1.         Requests the Government of India and the Government of Pakistan to refrain from making any statements and from doing or causing to be done or permitting any acts which might aggravate the situation, and to appeal to their respective peoples to assist in creating and maintaining an atmosphere favourable to the promotion of further negotiations;  
2.         Requests the United Nations Representative for India and Pakistan to make any recommendations to the parties for further appropriate action with a view to making progress towards the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan of 13 August 1948 and 5 January 1949 and towards a peaceful settlement;  
3.         Authorizes the United Nations Representative to visit the subcontinent for these purposes;  
4.         Instructs the United Nations Representative to report to the Security Council on his efforts as soon as possible.  
Adopted at the 808th meeting by 10 votes to none, with 1 abstention (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).
