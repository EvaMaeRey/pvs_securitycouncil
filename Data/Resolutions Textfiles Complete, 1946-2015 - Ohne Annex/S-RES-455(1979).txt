The Security Council,  
Taking note of the letter from the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Zambia contained in document S/13636,  
Having considered the statement of the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Zambia,  
Gravely concerned at the numerous hostile and unprovoked acts of aggression by the illegal minority regime in Southern Rhodesia violating the sovereignty, air space and territorial integrity of the Republic of Zambia,  
Gravely concerned also at the continuing collusion by South Africa in the repeated acts of aggression launched against the Republic of Zambia by the rebel forces of the illegal minority regime of Southern Rhodesia,  
Grieved at the tragic loss of human life and concerned about the damage and destruction of property resulting from the repeated acts of aggression committed by the illegal minority regime of Southern Rhodesia against the Republic of Zambia,  
Convinced that these wanton acts of aggression by the illegal minority regime of Southern Rhodesia form a consistent and sustained pattern of violations aimed at destroying the economic infrastructure of the Republic of Zambia and weakening its support of the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe for freedom and national liberation.  
Recalling its resolution 424 (1978) of 17 March 1978, in which, inter alia, it strongly condemned the armed invasion perpetrated by the illegal minority regime in the British Colony of Southern Rhodesia, which constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zambia,  
Reaffirming that the existance of the minority racist regime in Southern Rhodesia and the continuance of its acts of aggression against Zambia and other neighbouring States constitute a threat to international peace and security,  
Conscious of the need to take immediate and effective steps for the prevention and removal of all threats to international peace and security,  
1.       Strongly condemns the illegal regime in the British Colony of Southern Rhodesia for its continued, intensified and unprovoked acts of aggression against the Republic of Zambia, which constitute a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zambia;  
2.       Strongly condemns also the continued collusion by South Africa in repeated acts of aggression launched against the Republic of Zambia;  
3.       Commends the Republic of Zambia and other front-line States for their continued support of the people of Zimbabwe in their just and legitimate struggle for the attainment of freedom and independence and for their scrupulous restraint in the face of unwarranted armed provocations by the Rhodesian rebels in collusion with South African armed forces;  
4.       Calls upon the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the administering authority to take prompt and effective measures to ensure that the illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia desist from committing repeated acts of aggression and provocation against the Republic of Zambia;  
5.       Further calls for the payment of full and adequate compensation to the Republic of Zambia by the responsible authorities for the damage to life and property resulting from the acts of aggression;  
6.       Furthermore calls upon all Member States and international organizations urgently to extend material and other forms of assistance to the Republic of Zambia in order to facilitate the immediate reconstruction of its economic infrastructure;  
7.       Decides to establish an ad hoc committee composed of four members of the Security Council, to be appointed by the President, after consultation with members, in order to assist the Security Council in the implementation of this resolution, in particular paragraphs 5 and 6 thereof, and report to the Security Council by 15 December 1979;  
8.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
