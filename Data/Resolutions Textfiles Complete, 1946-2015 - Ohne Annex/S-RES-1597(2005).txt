Resolution 1597 (2005)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5165th meeting, on 20 April 2005
The Security Council,
Reaffirming its resolutions 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, 1166 (1998) of 13 May 1998, 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002, 1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002, 1481 (2003) of 19 May 2003, 1503 (2003) of 28 August 2003 and 1534 (2004) of 26 March 2004,
Having considered the letter from the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council dated 24 February 2005 (S/2005/127) transmitting the list of candidates for election as ad litem judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia,
Noting that the Secretary-General had suggested that the deadline for nominations be extended until 31 March 2005 and the President's reply of 14 March 2005 (S/2005/159) indicating that the Security Council had agreed to the extension of the deadline,
Having considered also the letter from the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council dated 11 April 2005 (S/2005/236) that suggested that the deadline for the nomination of candidates for election as ad litem judges be further extended,
Noting that the number of candidates continues to fall short of the minimum number required by the Statute of the Tribunal to be elected,
Considering that the 27 ad litem judges elected by the General Assembly at its 102nd plenary meeting on 12 June 2001 whose term of office expires on 11 June 2005, should be eligible for re-election and wishing to amend the Statute for that purpose,
Noting that, should the cumulative period of service of an ad litem judge of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia amount to three years or more, this will not result in any change in their entitlements or benefits and, in particular, will not give rise to any additional entitlements or benefits other than those that already exist and which will, in such an eventuality, be extended pro-rata by virtue of the extension of service,
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
