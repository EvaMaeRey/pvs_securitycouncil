The Security Council,  
Taking note of the letter dated 8 April 1980 from the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Zambia to the United Nations contained in document S/13878,  
Having considered the statement of the representative of the Republic of Zambia,  
Gravely concerned at the escalation of hostile and unprovoked acts by the racist regime of South Africa, violating the sovereignty, airspace and territorial integrity of the Republic of Zambia,  
Recalling its resolution 455 (1979) of 23 November 1979 in which, inter alia, it strongly condemned the collusion by racist South Africa with the then illegal regime of Southern Rhodesia, in acts of aggression against the Republic of Zambia,  
Grieved at the tragic loss of human life and concerned about the damage and destruction of property resulting from the escalated acts and armed incursions by the racist regime of South Africa against the Republic of Zambia,  
Deeply concerned that the wanton acts by the racist regime of South Africa are aimed at the destabilization of the Republic of Zambia,  
Conscious of the need to take effective measures to maintain international peace and security,  
1.       Strongly condemns the racist regime of South Africa for its continued, intensified and unprovoked acts against the Republic of Zambia, which constitute a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zambia;  
2.       Demands that South Africa withdraw forthwith all its military forces from the territory of the Republic of Zambia, cease all violations of Zambia's airspace and, henceforth, scrupulously respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Zambia;  
3.       Solemnly warns South Africa that in the event of any further armed incursions against the Republic of Zambia, the Security Council meet to consider further appropriate action under the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, including Chapter VII thereof;  
4.       Commends the Republic of Zambia for exercising maximum restraint in the face of serious provocations repeatedly committed against it by the racist regime of South Africa;  
5.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
