The Security Council,  
Taking note of the letter dated 17 June 1985 from the Permanent Representative of Botswana to the United Nations (S/17279) and having heard the statement of the Minister for External Affairs of Botswana concerning the recent acts of aggression by the racist regime of South Africa against the Republic of Botswana,  
Expressing its shock and indignation at the loss of human life, the injuries inflicted, and the extensive damage as a result of that action,  
Affirming the urgent need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Botswana and maintain peace and security in the southern African region,  
Reaffirming the obligation of all States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any State,  
Expressing its profound concern that the racist regime resorted to the use of military force against the defenceless and peace-loving nation of Botswana,  
Gravely concerned that such acts of aggression can only serve to aggravate the already volatile and dangerous situation in the southern African region,  
Bearing in mind that this latest incident is one in a series of provocative actions carried out by South Africa against Botswana and also that the racist regime has declared that it will continue and escalate such attacks,  
Commending Botswana for its unflagging adherence to the Convention relating to the status of refugees and of stateless persons and for the sacrifices it has made and continues to make in giving asylum to victims of apartheid,  
1.       Strongly condemns the recent unprovoked and unwarrented military attack on the capital of Botswana by South Africa as an act of aggression against that country and a gross violation of its territorial integrity and national sovereignty;  
2.       Further condemns all acts of aggression, provocation and harassment, including murder, blackmail, kidnapping and destruction of property committed by the racist regime of South Africa against Botswana;  
3.       Demands the immediate, total and unconditional cessation of all acts of aggression by South Africa against Botswana;  
4.       Denounces and rejects racist South Africa's practice of "hot pursuit" to terrorize and destabilize Botswana and other countries in the southern African region;  
5.       Demands full and adequate compensation by South Africa to Botswana for the damage to life and property resulting from such acts of aggression; 6. Affirms Botswana's right to receive and give sanctuary to the victims of apartheid in accordance with its traditional practice, humanitarian principles and international obligations;  
7.       Requests the Secretary-General to enter into immediate consultation with the Government of Botswana and the relevant United Nations agencies on measures to be undertaken to assist the Government of Botswana in ensuring the safety, protection and welfare of the refugees in Botswana;  
8.       Requests the Secretary-General to detail a mission to visit Botswana for the purpose of: (a) Assessing the damage caused by South Africa's unprovoked and premeditated acts of aggression; (b) Proposing measures to strengthen Botswana's capacity to receive and provide assistance to South African refugees; (c) Determining the consequent level of assistance required by Botswana and to report thereon to the Security Council;  
9.       Requests all States and relevant agencies and organizations of the United Nations system urgently to extend all necessary assistance to Botswana;  
10.     Requests the Secretary-General to monitor developments related to this question and to report to the Security Council as the situation demands;  
11.     Decides to remain seized of the matter.
