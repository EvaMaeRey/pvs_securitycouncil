The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolutions 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991, 721 (1991) of 27 November 1991, 724 (1991) of 15 December 1991 and 727 (1992) of 8 January 1992,  
Noting the further report of the Secretary-General of 5 February 1992 (S/23513) submitted pursuant to resolution 721 (1991) and welcoming his report that the cease-fire has been generally observed thus removing one of the obstacles to the deployment of a peace-keeping operation,  
Taking note that the letter of President Franjo Tudjman of 6 February 1992, in which he accepts fully and unconditionally the Secretary-General's concept and plan which defines the conditions and areas where the United Nations force would be deployed, removes a further obstacle in that respect,  
Further noting that the implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping plan will facilitate the task of the Conference on Yugoslavia in reaching a political settlement,  
Recalling its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security,  
Recalling also the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations,  
Expressing concern at the indications that the arms embargo established by the Security Council in resolution 713 (1991) is not being fully observed, as noted in paragraph 21 of the report of the Secretary-General (S/23513),  
1.       Reaffirms its approval set out in resolution 724 (1991) of the United Nations peace-keeping plan contained in the report of the Secretary-General of 11 December 1991 (S/23280);  
2.       Welcomes the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General and his personal envoy to remove the remaining obstacles in the way of the deployment of a peace-keeping operation;  
3.       Approves the Secretary-General's proposal to increase the authorized strength of the military liaison mission to a total of 75 officers;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General to expedite his preparations for a United Nations peace-keeping operation so as to be prepared to deploy immediately after the Security Council decides to do so;  
5.       Expresses its concern that the United Nations peace-keeping plan contained in the report of the Secretary-General of 11 December 1991 (S/23280) has not yet been fully and unconditionally accepted by all in Yugoslavia on whose cooperation its success depends;  
6.       Calls upon all States to take all appropriate steps to ensure that the Yugoslav parties implement their unqualified acceptance of the United Nations peace-keeping plan, fulfil their commitments in good faith and cooperate fully with the Secretary-General;  
7.       Calls upon the Yugoslav parties to cooperate fully with the Conference on Yugoslavia in its aim of reaching a political settlement consistent with the principles of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe;  
8.       Calls upon all States to cooperate fully with the Committee established by resolution 724 (1991) , including reporting any information brought to their attention concerning violations of the embargo;  
9.       Decides to remain actively seized of the matter until a peaceful solution is achieved.
