The Security Council,  
Taking note of the letter from the representative of the Republic of Zambia contained in document S/12147,  
Having considered the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Zambia,  
Gravely concerned at the numerous hostile and unprovoked acts by South Africa violating the sovereignty, air space and territorial integrity of the Republic of Zambia, resulting in death and injury of innocent people, as well as in the destruction of property, and culminating on 11 July 1976 in an armed attack which resulted in the regrettable loss of 24 innocent lives and the injury of 45 other persons,  
Gravely concerned at South Africa's use of the international Territory of Namibia as a base for attacking neighbouring African countries,  
Reaffirming the legitimacy of the struggle of the people of Namibia to liberate their country from the illegal occupation of the racist regime of South Africa,  
Convinced that the continuance of the deteriorating situation in southern Africa could constitute a threat to international peace and security,  
Conscious of the need to take effective steps for the prevention and removal of threats to international peace and security,  
Recalling its resolutoion 300 (1971) of 12 October 1971, which, inter alia, called upon South Africa to respect fully the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zambia,  
Bearing in mind that all Member States must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,  
1.       Strongly condemns the armed attack of South Africa against the Republic of Zambia, which constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Zambia;  
2.       Demands that South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty, air space and territorial integrity of the Republic of Zambia;  
3.       Demands that South Africa desist forthwith from the use of the international territory of Namibia as a base for launching armed attacks against the Republic of Zambia and other African countries;  
4.       Commends the Republic of Zambia and other "front-line" States for their steadfast support of the people of Namibia in their legitimate struggle for the liberation of their country from illegal occupation by the racist regime of South Africa;  
5.       Declares that the liberation of Namibia and Zimbabwe and the elimination of apartheid in South Africa are necessary for the attainment of justice and lasting peace in the region;  
6.       Further declares that, in the event of South Africa committing further acts of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zambia, the Security Council will meet again to consider the adoption of effectives measures, in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.
