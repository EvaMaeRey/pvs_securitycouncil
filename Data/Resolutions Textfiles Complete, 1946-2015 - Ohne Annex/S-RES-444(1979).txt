The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolutions 425 (1978) , 426 (1978) , 427 (1978) and 434 (1978) ,  
Recalling also the statement of the President of the Security Council of 8 December 1978 (S/12958),  
Having studied the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) contained in document S/13026 and Corr.1 of 12 January 1979,  
Expressing concern over the grave situation in southern Lebanon resulting from obstacles placed against the full implementation of resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) of 19 March 1978,  
Reiterating its conviction that the continuation of the situation constitutes a challenge to its authority and a defiance of its resolutions,  
Noting with regret that UNIFIL has reached the end of its second mandate without being enabled to complete all of the tasks assigned to it,  
Stressing that free and unhampered movement for UNIFIL is essential for the fulfilment of its mandate within its entire area of operation,  
Reaffirming the necessity for the strict respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries,  
Re-emphasizing the temporary nature of UNIFIL as set out in its terms of reference,  
Acting in response to the request of the Government of Lebanon taking into account the Secretary-General's report,  
1.       Deplores the lack of co-operation particularly on Israel's part with UNIFIL's efforts to fully implement its mandate including Israel's assistance to irregular armed groups in southern Lebanon;  
2.       Notes with great appreciation the efforts being made by the Secretary-General, the commanders and soldiers of UNIFIL and the United Nations staff, as well as Governments which have lent their assistance and co-operation;  
3.       Expresses its satisfaction with the declared policy of the Government of Lebanon and the steps already taken for the deployment of the Lebanese army in the south and encourages it to increase its efforts in co-ordination with UNIFIL to re-establish its authority in that area;  
4.       Decides to renew the mandate of UNIFIL for five months, that is, until 19 June 1979;  
5.       Calls upon the Secretary-General and UNIFIL to continue to take all effective measures deemed necessary in accordance with UNIFIL's approved guidelines and terms of reference as adopted by the Security Council (S/12611) and invites the Government of Lebanon to draw up, in consultation with the Secretary-General, a phased programme of activities to be carried out over the next three months to promote the restoration of its authority;  
6.       Urges all Member States which are in a position to do so to bring their influence to bear on those concerned so that UNIFIL can discharge its responsibilities fully and unhampered;  
7.       Reaffirms its determination, in the event of continuing obstruction of UNIFIL's mandate, to examine practical ways and means in accordance with relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations to secure the full implementation of resolution 425 (1978) ;  
8.       Decides to remain seized of the question and to meet again within three months to assess the situation.
