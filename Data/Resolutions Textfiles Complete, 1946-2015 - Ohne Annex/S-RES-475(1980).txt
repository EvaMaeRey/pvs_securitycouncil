The Security Council,  
Having considered the request by the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations contained in document S/14022, in which he requested the convening of an urgent meeting of the Security Council,  
Having heard the statement of the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of Angola to the United Nations,  
Recalling its resolutions 387 (1976) of 31 March 1976, 428 (1978) of 6 May 1978, 447 (1979) of 28 March 1979 and 454 (1979) of 2 November 1979, which, inter alia, condemned South Africa's aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and demanded that South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Gravely concerned at the escalation of hostile, unprovoked and persistent acts of aggression and sustained armed invasions committed by the racist regime of South Africa, in violation of the sovereignty, air space and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Convinced that the intensity and timing of these acts of armed invasion are intended to frustrate efforts at negotiated settlements in southern Africa, particularly in regard to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) of 29 September 1978,  
Grieved at the tragic loss of human life, mainly that of civilians, and concerned about the damage and destruction of property, including bridges and livestock, resulting from the escalated acts and armed incursions by the racist regime of South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola,  
Gravely concerned that these wanton acts of aggression by South Africa form a consistent and sustained pattern of violations aimed at weakening the unrelenting support of the front-line States for the movements for freedom and national liberation of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa,  
Conscious of the need to take effective measures to maintain international peace and security,  
1.       Strongly condemns the racist regime of South Africa for its premeditated persistent and sustained armed invasions of the People's Republic of Angola, which constitute a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of this country, as well as a serious threat to international peace and security;  
2.       Strongly condemns also South Africa's utilization of the international territory of Namibia as a springboard for armed invasions and destabilization of the People's Republic of Angola;  
3.       Demands that South Africa withdraw forthwith all its military forces from the territory of the People's Republic of Angola, cease all violations of Angola's air space and, henceforth, scrupulously respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola;  
4.       Calls upon all States to implement fully the arms embargo imposed against South Africa in resolution 418 (1977) of 4 November 1977;  
5.       Requests Member States urgently to extend all necessary assistance to the People's Republic of Angola and the other front-line States, in order to strengthen their defence capacities in the face of South Africa's acts of aggression against these countries;  
6.       Calls for the payment of full and adequate compensation to the People's Republic of Angola by South Africa for the damage to life and property resulting from these acts of aggression;  
7.       Decides to meet again in the event of further acts of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola by the South African racist regime in order to consider the adoption of more effective measures, in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, including Chapter VII thereof;  
8.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
