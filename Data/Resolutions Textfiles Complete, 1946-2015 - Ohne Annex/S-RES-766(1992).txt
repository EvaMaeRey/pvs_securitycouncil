The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolutions 668 (1990) of 20 September 1990, 717 (1991) of 16 October 1991, 718 (1991) of 31 October 1991, 728 (1992) of 8 January 1992, and 745 (1992) of 28 February 1992,  
Racalling the statement made by the President of the Security Council on 12 June 1992 (S/24091),  
Recalling also that any difficulty arising in the implementation of the Paris Agreements should be settled through close consultation between the SNC and UNTAC and must not be allowed to undermine the principles of these Agreements, or to delay the timetable for their implementation,  
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General dated 14 July 1992 (S/24286), and in particular of the fact that CPP, FUNCINPEC and KPNLF have agreed to proceed with phase II of the cease-fire as laid down in annex 2 of the first Paris Agreement and that the Party of Democratic Kampuchea has so far refused to do so,  
Taking note also of the declaration on the Cambodia Peace Process adopted in Tokyo on 22 June 1992 (S/24183), and the other efforts made there by the countries and parties concerned for the implementation of the Paris Agreements,  
1.       Expresses its deep concern at the difficulties met by UNTAC in the implementation of the Paris Agreements;  
2.       Underlines that all signatories of the Agreements are bound by all their obligations thereunder;  
3.       Deplores the continuing violations of the cease-fire and urges all parties to cease all hostilities forthwith, to cooperate fully with UNTAC in the marking of all minefields and to refrain from any deployment, movement, or other action intended to extend the territory they control or which might lead to renewed fighting;  
4.       Reaffirms the international community's firm commitment to a process under which UNTAC, operating freely throughout all of Cambodia as authorized by the Paris Agreements, can verify the departure of all foreign forces and ensure full implementation of the Agreements,  
5.       Demands that all parties respect the peaceful nature of UNTAC's mission and take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of all United Nations personnel;  
6.       Urges all parties to cooperate with UNTAC in broadcasting information helpful to implementation of the Paris Agreements;  
7.       Strongly deplores the continuing refusal by one of the parties to permit the necessary deployment of all components of UNTAC to the areas under its control to enable UNTAC to carry out its full functions in the implementation of the Paris Agreements;  
8.       Urges all States, in particular neighbouring countries, to provide assistance to UNTAC to ensure the effective implementation of the Paris Agreements;  
9.       Approves the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to continue to implement the Agreements despite the difficulties;  
10.     Invites in particular the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to accelerate the deployment of UNTAC's civilian components, especially the component mandated to supervise or control the existing administrative structures;  
11.     Demands that the Party that has failed so far to do so permit without delay the deployment of UNTAC in the areas under its control, and implement fully Phase II of the Plan as well as the other aspects of the Paris Agreements;  
12.     Requests the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to ensure that international assistance to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Cambodia from now on only benefits the parties which are fulfilling their obligations under the Paris Agreements and cooperating fully with UNTAC;  
13.     Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
