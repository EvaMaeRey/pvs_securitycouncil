The Security Council,  
Having considered the question of the death sentences passed on 19 August 1981 in South Africa on Mr. Anthony Tsotsobe, Mr. Johannes Shabangu and Mr. David Moise,  
Recalling its statement of 4 October 1982 (S/15444) regarding the death sentences passed on 6 August 1982 in South Africa on Mr. Thelle Simon Mogoerane, Mr. Jerry Semano Mosololi and Mr. Marcus Thabo Motaung, members of the African National Congress of South Africa, and reiterating its urgent appeal for executive clemency in this case,  
Gravely concerned over the confirmation by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa on 26 November 1982 of the death sentences imposed on Mr. Anthony Tsotsobe, Mr. Johannes Shabangu and Mr. David Moise,  
Conscious that the carrying out of the death sentences will further aggravate the situation in South Africa,  
1.       Calls upon the South African authorities to commute the death sentences imposed on the six men;  
2.       Urges all States and organizations to use their influence and to take urgent measures, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, the resolutions of the Security Council and relevant international instruments, to save the lives of the six men.
