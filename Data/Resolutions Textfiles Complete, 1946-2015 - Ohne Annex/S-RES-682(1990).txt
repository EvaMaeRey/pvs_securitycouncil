The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolution 186 (1964) establishing the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for an initial period of three months,  
Also recalling its subsequent resolutions extending the stationing in Cyprus of UNFICYP, most recently its resolution 680 (1990) ,  
Reaffirming the statement of the President of the Security Council of 30 May 1990 (S/21323) in which its members emphasized that United Nations peace-keeping operations must be launched and maintained on a sound and secure financial basis,  
Concerned about the chronic and ever-deepening financial crisis facing UNFICYP as described in the report of the Secretary-General (S/21981) and as expressed in the statement of the President of the Security Council of 15 June 1990 (S/21361),  
1.       Decides to examine the problem of the costs and financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), bearing in mind the financial crisis facing UNFICYP and the report of the United Nations Secretariat Review Team of 7 December 1990 (S/21982), in all its aspects, and to report by 1 June 1991 on alternative arrangements for meeting the costs of UNFICYP for which the United Nations is responsible to place the Force on a sound and secure financial basis.  
2.       Further decides to consider not later than early June 1991 comprehensively and favourably the results of the examination mentioned in paragraph 1, with a view that an alternative method of financing UNFICYP, which could, inter alia, include the use of assessed contributions, be put in effect simultaneously with the extension of its mandate on or before 15 June 1991.
