The Security Council,  
Noting from the report of the Secretary-General of 10 June 19663 that in the present circumstances the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus is still needed if peace is to be maintained in the island,  
Noting that the Government of Cyprus has agreed that in view of the prevailing conditions in the island it is necessary to continue the Force beyond 26 June 1966,  
1.         Reaffirms its resolutions 186 (1964) of 4 March, 187 (1964) of 13 March, 192 (1964) of 20 June, 193 (1964) of 9 August, 194 (1964) of 25 September and 198 (1964) of 18 December 1964, 201 (1965) of 19 March, 206 (1965) of 15 June, 207 (1965) of 10 August and 219 (1965) of 17 December 1965, and 220 (1966) of 16 March 1966, and the consensus expressed by the President at the 1143rd meeting, on 11 August 1964;  
2.         Urges the parties concerned to act with the utmost restraint and to make determined efforts with a view to achieving the objectives of the Security Council;  
3.         Extends the stationing in Cyprus of the United Nations Peace-keeping force, established under Security Council resolution 186 (1964), for a period of six months ending 26 December 1966, in the firm hope that by the end of this period substantial progress towards a solution will have been achieved so as to render possible a withdrawal or a substantial reduction of the Force.  
Adopted unanimously at the 1286th meeting.
