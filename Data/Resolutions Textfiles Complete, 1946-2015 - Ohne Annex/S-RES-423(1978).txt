The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolutions on the question of Southern Rhodesia and in particular resolution 415 (1977) of 29 September 1977,  
Reaffirming that the continued existence of the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia is a source of insecurity and instability in the region and constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security,  
Gravely concerned over the continued military operations by the illegal regime, including its acts of aggression against neighbouring independent States,  
Indignant at the continued executions of freedom fighters by the illegal regime,  
Considering the need for urgent measures to terminate the illegal regime and establish a government based on majority rule,  
1.       Condemns all attempts and manoeuvres by the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia aimed at the retention of power by a racist minority and at preventing the achievement of independence by Zimbabwe;  
2.       Declares illegal and unacceptable any internal settlement concluded under the auspices of the illegal regime and calls upon all States not to accord any recognition to such a settlement;  
3.       Further declares that the speedy termination of the illegal regime and the replacement of its military and police forces constitute the first prerequistie for the restoration of legality in Southern Rhodesia so that arrangements may be made for a peaceful and democratic transition to genuine majority rule and independence in 1978;  
4.       Declares also that such arrangements as envisaged in paragraph 3 of the present resolution include the holding of free and fair elections on the basis of universal adult sufferage under United Nations supervision;  
5.       Calls upon the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take all measures necessary to bring to an end the illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia and to effect the genuine decolonization of the Territory in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and other United Nations resolutions;  
6.       Considers that, with the assistance of the Secretary-General, the United Kingdom, as the administering Power, should enter into immediate consultations with the parties concerned in order to attain the objectives of genuine decolonization of the Territory through the implementation of paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the present resolution;  
7.       Requests the Secretary-General to report, not later than 15 April 1978, on the results of the implementation of the present resolution.
