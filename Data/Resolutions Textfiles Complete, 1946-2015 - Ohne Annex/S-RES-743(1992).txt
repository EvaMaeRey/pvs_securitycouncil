Noting the report of the Secretary-General of 15 February 1992 (S/23592) submitted pursuant to resolution 721 (1991) , and the request of the Government of Yugoslavia (S/23240) for a peace-keeping operation referred to in that resolution,  
Noting in particular that the Secretary-General considers that the conditions permitting the early deployment of a United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) are met and welcoming his recommendation that this Force should be established with immediate effect,  
Expressing its gratitude to the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for their contribution to the achievement of conditions facilitating the deployment of a United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and their continuing commitment to this effort,  
Concerned that the situation in Yugoslavia continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security, as determined in resolution 713 (1991) ,  
Recalling its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security,  
Recalling also the provisions of Article 25 Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations,  
Commending again the efforts undertaken by the European Community and its member States, with the support of the States participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, through the convening of a Conference on Yugoslavia, including the mechanisms set forth within it, to ensure a peaceful political settlement,  
Convinced that the implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping plan (S/23280, annex III) will assist the Conference on Yugoslavia in reaching a peaceful political settlement,  
1.       Approves the report of the Secretary-General of 15 February 1992 (S/23592);  
2.       Decides to establish, under its authority, a United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in accordance with the above-mentioned report and the United Nations peace-keeping plan and requests the Secretary-General to take the measures necessary to ensure its earliest possible deployment;  
3.       Decides that, in order to implement the recommendations in paragraph 30 of the report of the Secretary-General, the Force is established in accordance with paragraph 4 below, for an initial period of 12 months unless the Council subsequently decides otherwise;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General immediately to deploy those elements of the Force which can assist in developing an implementation plan for the earliest possible full deployment of the force for approval by the Council and a budget which together will maximize the contribution of the Yugoslav parties to offsetting its costs and in all other ways secure the most efficient and cost-effective operation possible;  
5.       Recalls that, in accordance with paragraph 1 of the United Nations peace-keeping plan, the Force should be an interim arrangement to create the conditions of peace and security required for the negotiation of an overall settlement of the Yugoslav crisis;  
6.       Invites accordingly the Secretary-General to report as appropriate and not less than every six months on progress towards a peaceful political settlement and the situation on the ground, and to submit a first report on the establishment of the Force within two months of the adoption of this resolution;  
7.       Undertakes, in this connection, to examine without delay any recommendations that the Secretary-General may make in his reports concerning the Force, including the duration of its mission, and to adopt appropriate decisions;  
8.       Urges all parties and others concerned to comply strictly with the cease-fire arrangements signed at Geneva on 23 November 1991 and at Sarajevo on 2 January 1992, and to cooperate fully and unconditionally in the implementation of the peace-keeping plan;  
9.       Demands that all parties and others concerned take all the necessary measures to ensure the safety of the personnel sent by the United Nations and of the members of the European Community Monitoring Mission;  
10.     Calls again upon the Yugoslav parties to cooperate fully with the Conference on Yugoslavia in its aim of reaching a political settlement consistent with the principles of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and reaffirms that the United Nations peace-keeping plan and its implementation is in no way intended to prejudge the terms of a political settlement;  
11.     Decides within the same framework that the embargo imposed by paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 713 (1991) shall not apply to weapons and military equipment destined for the sole use of UNPROFOR;  
12.     Requests all States to provide appropriate support to UNPROFOR, in particular to permit and facilitate the transit of its personnel and equipment;  
13.     Decides to remain actively seized of the matter until a peaceful solution is achieved.
