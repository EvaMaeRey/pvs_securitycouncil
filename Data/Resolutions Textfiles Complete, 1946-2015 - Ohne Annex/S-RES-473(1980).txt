The Security Council,  
Taking note of the letter dated 29 May 1980 from the Charge d'Affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Morocco to the United Nations contained in document S/13969,  
Gravely concerned over the aggravation of the situation in South Africa, in particular the repression and the killings of schoolchildren protesting against apartheid, as well as the repression against churchmen and workers,  
Noting also with grave concern that the racist regime has intensified further a series of arbitrary trials under its racist and repressive laws providing for death sentences,  
Convinced that this situation has been brought about by the continued imposition by the South African racist regime of apartheid in defiance of resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly,  
Recalling its resolutions on the question of South Africa, in particular resolutions 392 (1976) of 19 June 1976, 417 (1977) of 31 October 1977 and 418 (1977) of 4 November 1977,  
Recalling further resolutions 454 (1979) of 2 NOvember 1979 and 466 (1980) of 11 April 1980, in which South Africa was condemned for the flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighbouring African States,  
Reaffirming its recognition of the legitimacy of the struggle of the South African people for the elimination of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic society in accordance with their inalienable human and political rights as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  
Taking note of the extensive demands within and outside South Africa for the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners,  
Gravely concerned over reports of supply of arms and military equipment to South Africa in contravention of resolution 418 (1977) ,  
Taking note of the letter dated 27 March 1980 by the Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid concerning an oil embargo against South Africa (S/13869),  
Mindful of its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security,  
1.       Strongly condemns the racist regime of South Africa for further aggravating the situation and its massive repression against all opponents of apartheid, for killings of peaceful demonstrators and political detainees, and for its defiance of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 417 (1977) ;  
2.       Expresses its profound sympathy with the victims of this violence;  
3.       Reaffirms that the policy of apartheid is a crime against the conscience and dignity of mankind and is incompatible with the rights and dignity of man, the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and seriously disturbs international peace and security;  
4.       Recognises the legitimacy of the struggle of the South African people for the elimination of apartheid and for the establishment of a democratic society in which all the people of South Africa as a whole, irrespective of race, colour or creed, will enjoy equal and full political and other rights and participate freely in the determination of their destiny;  
5.       Calls upon the South African Government urgently to end violence against the African people and to take urgent measures to eliminate apartheid;  
6.       Expresses its hope that the inevitable change in South Africa's racial policies can be attained through peaceful means, and declares, however, that the violence and repression by the South African racist regime and its continuing denial of equal human and political rights to the great majority of the South African people greatly aggravate the situation in South Africa and will certainly lead to violent conflict and racial conflagration with serious international repercussions and the further isolation and estrangement of South Africa;  
7.       Calls upon the South African regime to take measures immediately to eliminate the policy of apartheid and grant to all South African citizens equal rights, including equal political rights, and a full and free voice in the determination of their destiny. These measures should include: (a) Granting of an unconditional amnesty to all persons imprisoned, restricted or exiled for their opposition to apartheid: (b) Cessation forthwith of its indiscriminate violence against peaceful demonstrators against apartheid, murders in detention and torture of political prisoners: (c) Abrogation of the bans on political parties and organizations and the news media opposed to apartheid: (d) Termination of all political trials; (e) Provision of equal education opportunities to all South Africans;  
8.       Urgently calls upon the South African regime to release all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela and all other black leaders with whom it must deal in any meaningful discussions of the future of the country;  
9.       Demands that the South African racist regime refrain from committing further military acts and subversion against independence African States;  
10.     Calls on all States strictly and scrupulously to implement resolution 418 (1977) and enact, as appropriate, effective national legislation for that purpose;  
11.     Requests the Security Council Committee established under resolution 421 (1977) in pursuance of resolution 418 (1977) on the question of South Africa to redouble its efforts to secure full implementation of the arms embargo against South Africa by recommending by 15 September 1980 measures to close all loopholes in the arms embargo, reinforce and make it more comprehensive;  
12.     Requests the Secretary-General to report by 15 September 1980 on the implementation of the present resolution;  
13.     Decides to remain seized of the question and to consider the situation again not later than 30 September 1980.
