The Security Council,  
Recalling the statement made by its President on 24 May 1985 (S/17215) on behalf of its members on the heightened violence in certain parts of Lebanon,  
Alarmed at the continued escalation of violence involving the civilian population, including Palestinians in refugee camps, resulting in grievous casualties, and material destruction on all sides,  
1.       Expresses anew its deepest concern at the heavy costs in human lives and material destruction affecting the civilian population in Lebanon, and calls on all concerned to end acts of violence against the civilian population in Lebanon and in particular in and around Palestinian refugee camps;  
2.       Reiterates its calls for respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon;  
3.       Calls on all parties to take necessary measures to alleviate the suffering resulting from acts of violence, in particular by facilitating the work of United Nations agencies, especially the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, and non-governmental organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, in providing humanitarian assistance to all those affected and emphasizes the need to ensure the safety of all the personnel of these organizations;  
4.       Appeals to all interested parties to co-operate with the Lebanese Government and the Secretary-General with a view to ensuring the implementation of this resolution and requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council;  
5.       Reaffirms its intention to continue to follow closely the situation.
