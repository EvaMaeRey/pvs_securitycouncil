Reaffirming its call for the strict respect for the territorial integrity, unity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries,

5.       Takes note of the efforts deployed by the Member States and more particularly the troop-contributing countries, in support of UNIFIL and urges all those which are in a position to do so to continue to use their influence with those concerned, so that the Force can discharge its responsibilities fully and unhampered;  
6.       Reaffirms its determination, in the event of continuing obstruction of the mandate of UNIFIL, to examine practical ways and means to secure the full implementation of resolution 425 (1978) ;
