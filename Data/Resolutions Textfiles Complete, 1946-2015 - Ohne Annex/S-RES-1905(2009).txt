Noting the letter from the Prime Minister of Iraq to the President of the Security Council, dated 13 December 2009, which is annexed to this resolution,
Recognizing the positive developments in Iraq and that the situation now existing in Iraq is significantly different from that which existed at the time of the adoption of resolution 661 (1990), recognizing that Iraqi institutions are strengthening, and further recognizing the importance of Iraq achieving international standing equal to that which it held prior to the adoption of resolution 661 (1990),
Recognizing that the letter from the Prime Minister of Iraq also reaffirms the commitment by the Government to resolve the debts and settle the claims inherited from the previous regime, and to continue to address those debts and claims until they are resolved or settled, and requests the continued assistance of the international community, as the Government of Iraq works to complete this process,
Recognizing the significant role of the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board, and the provisions of paragraph 22 of resolution 1483 (2003) in helping the Government of Iraq to ensure that Iraq's resources are being used transparently and accountably for the benefit of the Iraqi people, and recognizing also the need for Iraq during 2010 to transition to successor arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board, to include the Committee of Financial Experts (COFE),

4. Calls upon the Government of Iraq to put in place the necessary action plan and timeline by 1 April 2010 and to ensure the timely and effective transition to a post-Development Fund mechanism by 31 December 2010, which takes into account IMF Stand-By Arrangement requirements and includes external auditing arrangements and enables Iraq to meet its obligations as established in the provisions of paragraph 21 of resolution 1483 (2003);
