The Security Council,  
Having considered the latest developments in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe),  
Recalling Security Council resolutions on the situation in Southern Rhodesia, and in particular resolution 460 (1979) ,  
Noting that the Lancaster House Conference in London has produced agreement on the Constitution for a free and independent Zimbabwe providing for genuine majority rule, on arrangements for bringing that Constitution into effect and on a cease-fire,  
Noting also that the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, having resumed its responsibility as the Administering Power, is committed to decolonize Southern Rhodesia on the basis of free and democratic elections, which will lead Southern Rhodesia to genuine independence acceptable to the international community in accordance with the objectives of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV),  
Concerned at the numerous violations of the terms of the Lancaster House Agreement,  
Reaffirming the need for strict compliance with the terms of paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 460 (1979), which called upon the Administering Power to ensure that no South African or other external forces, regular or mercenary, would remain in or enter Southern Rhodesia, except those forces provided for under the Lancaster House Agreement,  
1.       Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination, freedom, and independence, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and in conformity with the objectives of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV);  
2.       Calls upon all parties to comply with the Lancaster House Agreement;  
3.       Calls upon the Administering Power to ensure the full and impartial implementation of the letter and spirit of the Lancaster House Agreement;  
4.       Calls upon the British Government, while noting its announcement that the South African troops have been withdrawn from the Beit Bridge, to ensure the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of any other South African forces, regular or mercenary, from Southern Rhodesia;

6.       Calls upon the British Government also to create conditions in Southern Rhodesia which will ensure a free and fair election and thereby avert the danger of the collapse of the Lancaster House Agreement, which could have serious consequences for international peace and security;  
7.       Calls upon the British Government to release any South African political prisoners, including captured freedom fighters in Southern Rhodesia, and to ensure their safe passage to any country of their choice;  
8.       Strongly condemns the racist regime in South Africa for interference in the internal affairs of Southern Rhodesia;  
9.       Calls upon all Member States of the United Nations to respect only the free and fair choice of the people of Zimbabwe;
