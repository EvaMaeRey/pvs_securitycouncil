The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolution 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991 and all subsequent relevant resolutions,  
Considering that the state formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist,  
Recalling in particular resolution 757 (1992) which notes that "the claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally accepted".  
1.       Considers that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations; and therefore recommends to the General Assembly that it decide that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly;  
2.       Decides to consider the matter again before the end of the main part of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.
