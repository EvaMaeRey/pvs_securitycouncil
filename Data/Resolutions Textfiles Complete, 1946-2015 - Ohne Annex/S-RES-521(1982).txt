The Security Council,  
Appalled at the massacre of Palestinian civilians in Beirut,  
Having heard the report of the Secretary-General (S/15400),  
Noting that the Government of Lebanon has agreed to the dispatch of United Nations Observers to the sites of greatest human suffering and losses in and around that city,  
1.       Condemns the criminal massacre of Palestinian civilians in Beirut;  
2.       Reaffirms once again its resolutions 512 (1982) and 513 (1982) which call for respect for the rights of the civilian population without any discrimination and repudiates all acts of violence against that population;  
3.       Authorizes the Secretary-General as a immediate step to increase the number of United Nations observers in and around Beirut from 10 to 50 and insists that there shall be no interference with the deployment of the observers and that they shall have full freedom of movement;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Government of Lebanon, to ensure the rapid deployment of those observers in order that they may contribute in every way possible within their mandate, to the effort to ensure full protection for the civilian population;  
5.       Requests the Secretary-General as a matter of urgency to initiate appropriate consultations and in particular consultations with the Government of Lebanon on additional steps which the Council might take, including the possible deployment of United Nations forces, to assist that Government in ensuring full protection for the civilian population in and around Beirut and requests him to report to the Council within forty-eight hours;  
6.       Insists that all concerned must permit United Nations observers and forces established by the Security Council in Lebanon to be deployed and to discharge their mandates and in this connexion solemnly calls attention to the obligation on all Member States under Article 25 of the Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Council in accordance with the Charter;  
7.       Requests the Secretary-General to keep the Council informed on an urgent and continuing basis.
