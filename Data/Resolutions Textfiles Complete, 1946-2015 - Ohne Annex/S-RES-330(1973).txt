The Security Council,  
Recalling General Assembly resolutions 1803 (XVII) of 14 December 1962 and 3016 (XXVII) of 18 December 1972 concerning permanent sovereignty over natural resources,  
Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, which states that no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind,  
Further recalling General Assembly resolution 2993 (XXVII) of 15 December 1972 on implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, in particular paragraph 4 thereof,  
Noting with deep concern the existence and use of coercive measures which affect the free exercise of permanent sovereignty over the natural resources of Latin America countries,  
Recognizing that the use of encouragement of the use of coercive measures may create situations likely to endanger peace and security in Latin America,  
1.         Urges States to adopt appropriate measures to impede the activities of those enterprises which deliberately attempt to coerce Latin American countries;  
2.         Requests States, with a view to maintaining and strengthening peace and security in Latin America, to refrain from using or encouraging the use of any type of coercive measures against States of the region.  
Adopted at the 1704th meeting by 12 votes to none with 3 abstentions (France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America)
