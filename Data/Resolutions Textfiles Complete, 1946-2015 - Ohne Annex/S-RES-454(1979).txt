The Security Council,  
Having considered the request by the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations contained in document S/13595, as well as his note dated 31 October 1979 transmitting the text of a communique issued by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the MPLA-Workers Party (S/13599),  
Having heard the statement of the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Recalling its resolutions 387 (1976) of 31 March 1976 and 447 (1979) of 28 March 1979, which, inter alia, condemned South Africa's aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and demanded that South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Gravely concerned at the premeditated, persistent and sustained armed invasions committeed by South Africa in violation of the sovereignty, air space and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola,  
Convinced that the intensity and timing of these acts of armed invasion are intended to frustrate efforts at negotiated settlements in southern Africa, particularly in regard to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) of 30 January 1976 and 435 (1978) of 29 September 1978,  
Grieved at the tragic loss of human life and concerned about the damage and destruction of property resulting from the repeated acts of aggression committed by South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola,  
Gravely concerned that these wanton acts of aggression by South Africa form a consistent and sustained pattern of violations aimed at weakening the unrelenting support of the front-line States to the movements for freedom and national liberation of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa,  
1.       Strongly condemns South Africa's aggression against the People's Republic of Angola;  
2.       Calls upon the Government of South Africa to cease immediately all acts of aggression and provocation against the People's Republic of Angola and forthwith to withdraw all its armed forces from Angola;  
3.       Demands that South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola;  
4.       Demands also that South Africa desist forthwith from the utilization of Namibia, a territory which it illegally occupies, to launch acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Angola or other neighbouring African States;  
5.       Requests Member States urgently to extend all necessary assistance to the People's Republic of Angola and other front-line States, in order to strengthen their defence capacities;  
6.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
