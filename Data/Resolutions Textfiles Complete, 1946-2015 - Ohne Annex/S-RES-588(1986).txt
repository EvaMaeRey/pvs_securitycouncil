The Security Council,  
Having considered the question entitled "The situation between Iran and Iraq",  
Noting that the Council has been seized with this question for over six years and that decisions have been taken thereon,  
Deeply alarmed about the prolongation and intensification of the conflict resulting in heavy losses of human lives and considerable material damage and endangering international peace and security,  
Noting the obligations of Member States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,  
Recalling the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and in particular the obligation of all Members to settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered,  
Recalling further that under the Charter, Member States have conferred on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and to this end have agreed to accept the role of the Security Council in the settlement of disputes,  
Commending the efforts of the Secretary-General in the search for a peaceful settlement of the conflict,  
1.       Calls upon Iran and Iraq to implement fully and without delay resolution 582 (1986) adopted unanimously on 24 February 1986;  
2.       Requests the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts with the parties to give effect to the above-mentioned resolution and to report to the Council no later than 30 November 1986;  
3.       Decides to meet again to consider the report of the Secretary-General and the conditions for the establishment of a durable peace between the two countries in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of justice and international law.
